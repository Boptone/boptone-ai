# Boptone Investor Presentation V2
## Updated with Tone Rewards System

---

## Slide 1: Title
**Boptone**
Own Your Tone.

Music Business 2.0 - The Operating System for Independent Artists

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**The Music Industry is Broken for Artists**

- 1 million Spotify streams = ~$3,000-4,000 (before splits)
- Artists have NO idea who their fans are
- Labels take 80-85% of master recordings
- Publishers take 50%+ of publishing rights
- Platforms control discovery algorithms
- No direct fan relationships

**Result:** Artists are quitting. They can't make a living.

---

## Slide 3: The Shift
**The Industry is Splitting in Two**

Not between big and small. Between:
- Companies building **platforms** vs. companies acting like **brands**
- **Ecosystems** vs. **SKUs**
- **Belief systems** vs. **logos**

The next category leaders won't win because of products.
They'll win because of ecosystems where media, data, manufacturing, distribution, and storytelling operate as one engine.
