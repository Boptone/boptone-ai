## Section 20: Shipping and Fulfillment Services

### 20.1 Shipping Services Overview

Boptone provides shipping and fulfillment services for physical products sold through the BopShop e-commerce platform. Shipping services are provided through Shippo, a third-party shipping aggregator, which facilitates access to multiple carriers including the United States Postal Service (USPS), FedEx, United Parcel Service (UPS), DHL, and other carriers (collectively, "Carriers"). By using the shipping services, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Section 20 in addition to all other provisions of these Terms.

### 20.2 Seller Responsibilities

If you are a seller using Boptone's shipping services to fulfill orders, you agree to the following responsibilities:

**Product Information Accuracy:** You are solely responsible for providing accurate product information, including but not limited to product weight, dimensions, packaging requirements, and any special handling instructions. Inaccurate product information may result in incorrect shipping rates, delivery delays, or carrier refusal to transport the package.

**Packaging Standards:** You must package all products securely and appropriately to withstand normal shipping conditions. You are responsible for ensuring that products are properly protected against damage during transit. Boptone is not liable for damage to products that result from inadequate packaging.

**Prohibited Items:** You may not ship any items that are prohibited by law or by the Carriers' terms of service, including but not limited to hazardous materials, illegal substances, weapons, explosives, flammable materials, perishable goods without proper packaging, live animals, or items that violate intellectual property rights. Shipping prohibited items may result in immediate account suspension, legal liability, and reporting to law enforcement authorities.

**Compliance with Laws:** You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing the shipment of your products, including but not limited to export control laws, customs regulations, trade sanctions, and product safety standards. For international shipments, you must provide accurate customs declarations and are responsible for all customs duties, taxes, and fees.

**Timely Fulfillment:** You agree to ship orders within the timeframe specified in your product listings or, if no timeframe is specified, within three (3) business days of receiving the order. Failure to ship orders in a timely manner may result in customer complaints, refund requests, and account penalties.

### 20.3 Buyer Responsibilities

If you are a buyer purchasing products through BopShop, you agree to the following responsibilities:

**Address Accuracy:** You are solely responsible for providing a complete and accurate shipping address, including recipient name, street address, city, state/province, postal code, and country. Boptone provides address validation as a courtesy, but validation does not guarantee successful delivery. You acknowledge that Boptone, sellers, and Carriers are not liable for packages delivered to an incorrect address due to your error.

**Availability for Delivery:** You are responsible for being available to receive packages or arranging for someone to receive packages on your behalf. If a package requires a signature and no one is available to sign, the Carrier may attempt redelivery or hold the package at a local facility for pickup. Boptone is not responsible for packages returned to the seller due to failed delivery attempts.

**Inspection Upon Delivery:** You agree to inspect packages upon delivery and report any visible damage to the Carrier immediately. Failure to report damage at the time of delivery may affect your ability to file a claim for damaged goods.

**Customs Duties and Taxes:** For international orders, you are responsible for all customs duties, taxes, import fees, and any other charges imposed by your country's customs authority. These charges are not included in the shipping cost and are your sole responsibility. Refusal to pay customs charges may result in the package being returned to the seller or destroyed by customs, and you will not be entitled to a refund.

### 20.4 Shipping Rates and Charges

Shipping rates are calculated in real-time based on package weight, dimensions, origin address, destination address, selected shipping method, and current Carrier rates. Shipping rates displayed at checkout are estimates and may be subject to adjustment if the actual package weight or dimensions differ from the information provided by the seller.

Sellers may choose to offer free shipping, flat-rate shipping, or real-time carrier-calculated shipping. Shipping charges are separate from product prices and are non-refundable except as provided in Section 20.8 (Refunds and Returns).

Boptone reserves the right to charge additional fees for special handling, oversized packages, remote area delivery, or other circumstances that result in additional costs.

### 20.5 Shipping Methods and Delivery Times

Delivery times are estimates provided by the Carriers and are not guaranteed by Boptone or sellers. Actual delivery times may vary due to factors beyond our control, including but not limited to weather conditions, natural disasters, carrier delays, customs processing, holidays, pandemics, labor strikes, transportation disruptions, and other force majeure events.

Boptone offers the following shipping methods (availability may vary by destination):

- **Standard Shipping:** Estimated delivery in 5-7 business days (USPS Ground, FedEx Ground, UPS Ground)
- **Expedited Shipping:** Estimated delivery in 2-3 business days (USPS Priority Mail, FedEx 2Day, UPS 2nd Day Air)
- **Express Shipping:** Estimated delivery in 1-2 business days (USPS Priority Mail Express, FedEx Overnight, UPS Next Day Air)
- **International Shipping:** Estimated delivery in 7-21 business days (varies by destination)

Delivery time estimates begin from the date of shipment, not the date of order placement. Boptone and sellers are not liable for delivery delays caused by Carriers or circumstances beyond our control.

### 20.6 Tracking and Delivery Confirmation

All shipments include tracking numbers that allow you to monitor the status of your package. Tracking information is provided by the Carriers and is updated as the package moves through the shipping network. Tracking information may be delayed or incomplete due to Carrier system issues.

For orders shipped via methods that include delivery confirmation, the Carrier's delivery confirmation serves as proof of delivery. Boptone and sellers are not responsible for packages marked as "delivered" by the Carrier, even if you did not receive the package. In such cases, you should contact the Carrier directly to file a claim or investigate the delivery.

### 20.7 Lost, Damaged, or Stolen Packages

**Liability Limitation:** Boptone is not liable for packages that are lost, damaged, stolen, or delayed during transit. Liability for lost or damaged packages rests with the Carrier or, in some cases, the seller. Boptone acts solely as a facilitator of shipping services and does not assume responsibility for Carrier performance.

**Filing Claims:** If your package is lost or damaged during transit, you must file a claim with the Carrier within the timeframe specified by the Carrier's terms of service (typically 60 days from the ship date). Boptone and sellers will reasonably cooperate with claim investigations by providing necessary documentation, but we do not guarantee that claims will be approved or that you will receive compensation.

**Stolen Packages:** Boptone and sellers are not responsible for packages stolen after delivery. If a package is marked as "delivered" by the Carrier but you did not receive it, you should:
1. Check with neighbors, household members, or building management
2. Verify the delivery address on your order
3. Contact the Carrier to investigate the delivery
4. File a police report if you believe the package was stolen
5. Contact the seller to request assistance

Sellers may, at their sole discretion, offer replacements or refunds for stolen packages, but they are not obligated to do so.

**Insurance:** Sellers may purchase shipping insurance to protect against loss or damage. Insurance coverage is optional and is the seller's responsibility. Buyers should contact sellers directly to inquire about insurance coverage for high-value items.

### 20.8 Returns and Refunds

Return and refund policies are set by individual sellers and must be clearly disclosed on product pages. Boptone does not impose a universal return policy but requires sellers to honor the return policies they publish.

**Return Shipping Costs:** Unless the product is defective, damaged during shipping, or not as described, the buyer is responsible for return shipping costs. Sellers may provide prepaid return labels at their discretion.

**Refund of Shipping Charges:** Original shipping charges are non-refundable unless the seller failed to ship the product, the product was defective or damaged during shipping, or the product was not as described. Expedited or express shipping upgrades are non-refundable in all circumstances.

**Restocking Fees:** Sellers may charge restocking fees for returned items, provided such fees are disclosed in the product listing or seller's return policy. Restocking fees typically range from 10% to 20% of the product price.

### 20.9 International Shipping

**Customs and Duties:** International shipments are subject to customs inspection and may be subject to customs duties, taxes, import fees, and other charges imposed by the destination country. These charges are the buyer's sole responsibility and are not included in the product price or shipping cost. Boptone and sellers have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount.

**Customs Declarations:** Sellers are responsible for providing accurate customs declarations, including product descriptions, values, and country of origin. Providing false or misleading customs information is illegal and may result in account termination and legal consequences.

**Customs Delays and Rejections:** Packages may be delayed or rejected by customs authorities for various reasons, including incomplete documentation, prohibited items, or failure to pay customs charges. Boptone and sellers are not responsible for customs delays or rejections. If a package is returned to the seller due to customs issues, the buyer may not be entitled to a refund.

**Export Restrictions:** Certain products may be subject to export restrictions or prohibitions. Sellers are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable export control laws. Buyers are responsible for ensuring that products can be legally imported into their country.

### 20.10 Third-Party Shipping Services

Boptone uses Shippo as a third-party shipping aggregator to facilitate access to Carriers. By using the shipping services, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. Shippo and the Carriers are independent third parties and are not agents, employees, or representatives of Boptone.
2. Your use of Shippo and Carrier services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies.
3. Boptone is not responsible for the acts, omissions, or policies of Shippo or the Carriers.
4. Shippo and the Carriers may collect and use your information (including shipping addresses) in accordance with their own privacy policies.
5. Boptone makes no warranties regarding the performance, reliability, or availability of Shippo or Carrier services.

### 20.11 Limitation of Liability for Shipping Services

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BOPTONE'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO SHIPPING SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE SHIPPING CHARGES PAID FOR THE SPECIFIC SHIPMENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. BOPTONE IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO SHIPPING SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION.

## Section 21: Search Engine Optimization and Content Indexing

### 21.1 Structured Data and SEO Services

Boptone automatically generates structured data, meta tags, sitemaps, and other search engine optimization (SEO) and generative engine optimization (GEO) content to improve the discoverability of artist profiles, product listings, and other content on the Service. This includes but is not limited to:

- JSON-LD structured data using schema.org vocabularies (MusicGroup, Product, Store, BreadcrumbList, and other schemas)
- Meta tags for social media platforms (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- Dynamic sitemaps (sitemap.xml) for search engine crawlers
- Breadcrumb navigation with structured data
- GEO-optimized content designed for citation by large language models (LLMs) and AI assistants

By using the Service and creating content, you acknowledge and agree that Boptone may generate and publish structured data derived from your content for the purpose of improving discoverability.

### 21.2 Search Engine and LLM Indexing

Your publicly accessible content on Boptone, including artist profiles, product listings, and other information you choose to make public, may be indexed by search engines (such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and others) and large language models (such as ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and others). This indexing is a standard practice on the internet and is necessary for users to discover your content through search engines and AI assistants.

You acknowledge and agree that:

1. Search engines and LLMs may crawl, index, cache, and display your publicly accessible content.
2. LLMs may cite, reference, or summarize your content in responses to user queries.
3. Boptone has no control over how search engines or LLMs index, display, or cite your content.
4. Boptone is not responsible for the accuracy of information displayed by search engines or LLMs.

### 21.3 Ownership of Structured Data

You retain all ownership rights to the original content you create and upload to the Service. However, you grant Boptone a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, and distribute structured data generated from your content for the purpose of SEO, GEO, and improving discoverability.

Structured data generated by Boptone (such as JSON-LD schemas, meta tags, and sitemaps) is considered a derivative work created by Boptone, and Boptone retains ownership of such structured data. This does not affect your ownership of the underlying original content.

### 21.4 Opt-Out of Search Engine Indexing

If you do not want your content to be indexed by search engines or LLMs, you may opt out by:

1. Setting your artist profile or product listings to "private" or "unlisted" in your account settings.
2. Contacting Boptone at hello@boptone.com to request exclusion from sitemaps and search engine indexing.
3. Using the robots.txt exclusion mechanism (available in account settings for Enterprise users).

Please note that opting out of search engine indexing will significantly reduce the discoverability of your content and may negatively impact your ability to reach new fans and customers. Opting out does not guarantee that your content will be removed from search engine caches or LLM training data that has already been collected.

### 21.5 Accuracy of Structured Data

Boptone makes reasonable efforts to ensure that structured data generated from your content is accurate and up-to-date. However, Boptone does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of structured data. You are responsible for ensuring that the information in your artist profile and product listings is accurate and current.

Boptone is not liable for any damages arising from inaccurate or outdated structured data, including but not limited to lost sales, reputational harm, or search engine penalties.

### 21.6 Third-Party Search Engines and LLMs

Boptone does not control and is not responsible for the actions, policies, or practices of third-party search engines or LLMs. Your content may be indexed, cached, displayed, or cited by these third parties in accordance with their own terms of service and privacy policies. Boptone is not liable for how third-party search engines or LLMs use, display, or cite your content.

## Section 22: Agent API and Third-Party AI Integration

### 22.1 Agent API Overview

Boptone provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows third-party artificial intelligence (AI) agents, chatbots, virtual assistants, and other automated systems (collectively, "AI Agents") to access certain features and data on the Service. The Agent API enables AI Agents to search for artists and products, retrieve information, and, with user authorization, initiate transactions on behalf of users.

Access to the Agent API is subject to the terms of this Section 22 in addition to all other provisions of these Terms. If you are a developer or operator of an AI Agent, you agree to comply with these terms and any additional API documentation provided by Boptone.

### 22.2 API Authentication and Authorization

Access to the Agent API requires authentication using OAuth 2.0 or API keys provided by Boptone. You must register your AI Agent with Boptone and obtain valid credentials before accessing the API.

**User Authorization:** AI Agents must obtain explicit authorization from users before accessing user data or performing actions on their behalf. Users must be presented with a clear and conspicuous authorization prompt that explains:
1. What data the AI Agent will access
2. What actions the AI Agent will perform
3. How the AI Agent will use the data
4. How users can revoke authorization

Users may revoke AI Agent authorization at any time through their Boptone account settings. Upon revocation, the AI Agent must immediately cease accessing the user's data and delete any cached or stored user data.

### 22.3 Rate Limiting and API Quotas

The Agent API is subject to rate limits to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse. Current rate limits are:

- **Search Endpoint:** 1,000 requests per hour per API key

Exceeding rate limits will result in temporary suspension of API access (HTTP 429 Too Many Requests). Repeated violations may result in permanent suspension of API access and account termination.

Boptone reserves the right to modify rate limits at any time with or without notice. Enterprise users may request higher rate limits by contacting hello@boptone.com.

1. Scrape, harvest, or collect data for purposes other than providing services to authorized users
2. Build a competing product or service
3. Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the API or Service

5. Transmit viruses, malware, or other malicious code
6. Violate any applicable laws or regulations
7. Infringe on intellectual property rights
8. Engage in fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading practices
9. Spam users or send unsolicited commercial messages
10. Access data or perform actions without proper user authorization

Violation of these prohibitions may result in immediate API access suspension, account termination, and legal action.

### 22.5 AI Agent Liability and User Responsibility

1. You are responsible for all actions taken by the AI Agent using your account.

4. They will provide clear and accurate disclosures to users about how their AI Agent works.
5. They will promptly address user complaints and security incidents.

### 22.6 No Warranty for AI Agent Services

BOPTONE MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY, ACCURACY, OR AVAILABILITY OF THE AGENT API OR ANY AI AGENTS THAT ACCESS THE SERVICE. AI AGENTS ARE THIRD-PARTY SERVICES THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY BOPTONE. BOPTONE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, ERRORS, SECURITY BREACHES, OR PRIVACY PRACTICES OF AI AGENTS.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AI AGENTS MAY MAKE ERRORS, PROVIDE INACCURATE INFORMATION, OR PERFORM UNINTENDED ACTIONS. YOU USE AI AGENTS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

### 22.7 Limitation of Liability for Agent API

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BOPTONE'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE AGENT API OR AI AGENT SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00 USD). BOPTONE IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE AGENT API OR AI AGENTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO UNAUTHORIZED PURCHASES, DATA BREACHES, FINANCIAL LOSSES, OR REPUTATIONAL HARM.

### 22.8 Indemnification for API Use

If you are a developer or operator of an AI Agent, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Boptone from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to:

1. Your AI Agent's access to or use of the Agent API
2. Your AI Agent's actions or errors
3. Your violation of these Terms or applicable laws
4. Unauthorized access to user data by your AI Agent
5. Security breaches or data leaks caused by your AI Agent
6. Intellectual property infringement by your AI Agent
7. User complaints or disputes arising from your AI Agent's actions

### 22.9 API Modifications and Termination

Boptone reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Agent API at any time, with or without notice, for any reason. We may also modify rate limits, authentication requirements, or other API terms at any time.

Boptone may terminate your API access at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. Reasons for termination may include but are not limited to:

1. Violation of these Terms
2. Abuse of the API or excessive usage
3. Security concerns
4. Legal or regulatory requirements
5. Business reasons

Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the API and delete all cached or stored data obtained from the API.
