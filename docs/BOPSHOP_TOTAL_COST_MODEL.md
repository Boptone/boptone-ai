## 💡 Boptone POD Strategy Recommendation

### **Option 1: Multi-Provider Integration (Recommended)**
- Integrate with **Printful** (premium quality) + **Printify** (budget option)
- Let artists choose provider per product

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Artists control quality vs. cost tradeoff

- ✅ Simple to implement (both have APIs)

### **Option 2: Boptone In-House POD (Future)**
- Build Boptone's own print facilities
- Offer 10-20% lower costs than Printful
- Take 5-10% margin on POD sales
- Requires significant capital investment

**Why this is risky:**
- ❌ High upfront costs ($500k-$2M for equipment)
- ❌ Inventory management complexity
- ❌ Quality control challenges
- ❌ Competes with artists' existing POD relationships
