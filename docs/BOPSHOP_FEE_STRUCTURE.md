# BopShop Fee Structure for Physical Goods
**Artist-First E-Commerce for Merch, Vinyl, and Physical Products**

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

BopShop follows Boptone's artist-first model: **transparent pricing, no hidden fees, and artists keep the maximum revenue possible.** Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that take 10-30% cuts, BopShop only charges:

1. **Credit card processing fees** (passed through to artist, not marked up)
2. **Small platform fee** (3-5% depending on volume)

## 📋 Recommended Pricing Tiers (Future Optimization)

### **Volume-Based Discounts**
As artists scale, reduce platform fee to incentivize growth:

| Monthly Sales Volume | Platform Fee (Boptone Payments) | Platform Fee (External) |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| $0 - $1,000 | 3% | 5% |
| $1,001 - $10,000 | 2.5% | 4% |
| $10,001 - $50,000 | 2% | 3% |
| $50,001+ | 1.5% | 2% |

**Example:** Artist selling $5,000/month in merch:
- **Current:** Pays 3% = $150/mo platform fee
- **Tier 2:** Pays 2.5% = $125/mo platform fee
- **Savings:** $25/mo ($300/year)
