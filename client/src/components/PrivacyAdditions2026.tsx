          When you create a release for distribution through Boptone's Distribution Services, we collect and store the
          following release metadata: release title, subtitle, release type (single, EP, album, compilation), primary and
          secondary genres, display artist name, label name, Universal Product Code (UPC) or European Article Number (EAN),
          global release date, original release date, parental advisory classification, P-Line (master recording copyright

          metadata required by the DDEX ERN 4.1 standard for delivery to digital service providers ("DSPs").
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We transmit this metadata to DSPs as part of the DDEX ERN 4.1 delivery package. DSPs may store, process, and
          display this metadata in accordance with their own privacy policies. Boptone is not responsible for how DSPs
          handle release metadata once it has been delivered.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Territory Deal Data</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For each release, we collect territory deal data specifying the markets in which you authorize distribution.
          Territory deal data includes: territory code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code or "Worldwide"), pricing tier,
          streaming rights flag, download rights flag, deal start date, deal end date (if applicable), master rights
          confirmation status, and publishing handling method (self-published, PRO-registered, or publisher-administered).
          This data is used to configure DSP delivery packages and to enforce your distribution authorization in each market.

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Rights Attestation Data</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When you submit a release for distribution, you are required to complete a Rights Attestation confirming that
          you hold the necessary rights to distribute the release in each territory you have selected. We collect and

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Legal basis for collection:</strong> Rights Attestation data is collected pursuant to Boptone's legitimate
          legal interests in maintaining an auditable record of artist representations for the purpose of defending against
          third-party intellectual property claims, complying with applicable law, and enforcing the indemnification
          obligations set forth in Section 24.5 of our Terms of Service. This data is not used for marketing, advertising,
          or any purpose other than legal compliance and dispute resolution.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Retention period:</strong> Rights Attestation records are retained for a minimum of seven (7) years
          following the date of attestation, regardless of whether your account remains active or has been deleted. This
          retention period reflects the applicable statute of limitations for copyright infringement claims under 17 U.S.C.
          &sect; 507(b) and equivalent statutes in other jurisdictions. Rights Attestation records cannot be deleted through
          standard account deletion requests because they constitute legally required records.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Disclosure:</strong> Rights Attestation records, including your IP address and the full attestation text,
          may be disclosed to: (a) record labels, distributors, or other rights holders who assert a credible claim that
          your distribution infringes their rights; (b) law enforcement or regulatory authorities pursuant to a valid legal
          process; (c) courts or arbitral tribunals in connection with legal proceedings; or (d) Boptone's legal counsel

          You may access, correct, or delete your release metadata and territory deal data through your Boptone dashboard
