                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payout Schedules:</strong> You may choose to receive payouts on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule through your account settings. All payout schedules are subject to a minimum withdrawal amount of $20 USD (or equivalent in your local currency). Standard payouts are processed at no additional cost and typically arrive in your designated bank account or payment method within one (1) business day of the payout request, subject to banking processing times.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">

Instant payouts are subject to a 1% processing fee and a minimum withdrawal amount of $50 USD. Instant payout availability may vary based on your location, payment method, and account standing.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payment Methods:</strong> We support various payout methods including direct bank transfer (ACH in the US, SEPA in Europe), PayPal, and other region-specific payment providers. The availability of specific payment methods depends on your location and account verification status.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Verification Requirements:</strong> To receive payouts, you must complete identity verification and provide accurate banking or payment information. We may request additional documentation to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Failure to complete verification may result in delayed or withheld payouts.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payout Holds:</strong> We reserve the right to hold payouts for up to 30 days in cases of suspected fraud, chargebacks, disputes, or violations of these Terms. We will notify you of any holds and the reasons for them.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Currency Conversion:</strong> If your payout currency differs from the currency in which you earned revenue, we will convert funds at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of payout. Currency conversion fees may apply and will be clearly disclosed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tax Reporting:</strong> You are responsible for reporting all income earned through the Service and paying applicable taxes. We may provide tax documentation (such as 1099 forms for US users) as required by law. International users may need to provide tax identification information to comply with local regulations.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">6.7 Payment Processing Services</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Boptone provides payment processing services for three distinct revenue streams: BopShop (merchandise sales), BopAudio (streaming payments), and Kick-in (fan support tips). By using these payment services, you agree to be bound by the following terms.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>BopShop Merchandise Sales:</strong> When you sell physical or digital products through BopShop, Boptone charges a platform fee of 10% of the transaction value. You are responsible for fulfilling orders, managing inventory, providing accurate product descriptions, and handling customer service. All sales are final unless otherwise required by law or your stated refund policy. We are not liable for the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of the products you sell.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>BopAudio Streaming Payments:</strong> Artists using BopAudio receive 90% of streaming revenue, with Boptone retaining 10% as a platform fee. Streaming payments are processed through our payment provider (Stripe) and are subject to their terms of service. We are not responsible for the quality, availability, or content of music streamed through BopAudio.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Kick-in Fan Support Tips:</strong> Kick-in allows fans to send monetary tips directly to artists. Boptone charges zero platform fees for tips—only standard payment processing fees apply (typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, set by our payment processor). Tips are considered gifts from fans to artists and are not refundable except as required by law. Tips are subject to velocity limits and compliance monitoring as described in Section 6.9.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payment Processing Provider:</strong> All payment processing is handled by Stripe, Inc., a third-party payment processor. Your use of Stripe's services is subject to their terms of service and privacy policy. We do not store your full credit card information on our servers. By using our payment services, you authorize Stripe to process payments on your behalf.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Stripe Connect Direct Payment Routing:</strong> Boptone uses Stripe Connect to facilitate direct payments from customers to artists. When a customer makes a purchase through BopShop, streams music via BopAudio, or sends a Kick-in tip, the payment is routed directly from the customer's payment method to the artist's connected Stripe account. Boptone acts as a platform facilitator and deducts the applicable platform fee (10% for BopShop, 10% for BopAudio, 0% for Kick-in) as a destination charge before the funds are deposited into the artist's account. This means artists receive payments directly from customers, not from Boptone. By using our payment services, you agree to create and maintain a Stripe Connect account and comply with Stripe's Connected Account Agreement and Services Agreement.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Platform Liability Limitations:</strong> We provide payment processing services "as is" and to the maximum extent permitted by law, disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We are not liable for any delays, failures, or problems inherent in the use of the internet, electronic communications, or payment processing systems outside our control. Our only responsibility is to facilitate payment transactions—we have no liability for the underlying goods, services, or content being purchased.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>All Payments Final:</strong> All payments made through the Service are final unless otherwise required by law. If you believe an unauthorized or problematic transaction has occurred, you must notify us immediately at hello@boptone.com. Unless you submit a claim within 30 days after the charge, you will have waived, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims against us arising out of or related to the transaction.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">6.8 Multi-Currency Transactions</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Boptone supports transactions in 135+ currencies and accepts 18 global payment methods, including credit/debit cards, CashApp, Klarna, WeChat Pay, Alipay, and other region-specific payment methods. The availability of specific payment methods depends on your location and the transaction type.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Currency Exchange:</strong> If your transaction requires a currency exchange, we will use the most recent foreign exchange rates sourced from one or more external vendors at the time of the transaction. Exchange rates may differ from prevailing market rates and are subject to change without notice. Currency conversion fees may apply and will be disclosed before you complete the transaction.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Pricing Display:</strong> Prices displayed on the Service are in the currency you select. The final amount charged to your payment method may differ due to currency conversion, taxes, and payment processing fees. You are responsible for any additional fees charged by your bank or payment provider for international transactions.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">6.9 Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Compliance</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Boptone is committed to preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. We comply with all applicable anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Identity Verification:</strong> To use payment services, you must complete identity verification by providing government-issued identification, proof of address, and other documentation as required. We may use third-party identity verification services to confirm your identity. Failure to complete verification may result in restricted access to payment features or account suspension.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Velocity Limits and Transaction Monitoring:</strong> To prevent money laundering and fraud, we impose the following limits on Kick-in tips: (1) $500 maximum per transaction, (2) $1,000 maximum per day, (3) $2,500 maximum per week, (4) $10,000 maximum per month, and (5) $19,000 maximum per year. We monitor all transactions for suspicious activity and may hold, delay, or refuse transactions that violate these limits or appear fraudulent.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Suspicious Activity Reporting:</strong> We may freeze accounts, hold funds, or terminate access to payment services if we suspect fraudulent activity, money laundering, or violations of these Terms. We take fraud prevention seriously to protect all artists on the platform.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Fraud Warning:</strong> Use of Boptone's payment services to perform fraudulent activities or transactions may result in the permanent loss of funds with no recourse and immediate account termination. Do not attempt to structure transactions to evade reporting requirements or circumvent velocity limits—doing so will result in account termination.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">6.10 Tax Obligations and Reporting</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Your Tax Responsibilities:</strong> You are solely responsible for determining, collecting, reporting, and remitting all applicable taxes on income earned through the Service, including income taxes, sales taxes, value-added taxes (VAT), goods and services taxes (GST), and any other taxes required by your jurisdiction. Boptone does not provide tax advice—consult a qualified tax professional for guidance.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Kick-in Tax Implications:</strong> Tips received through Kick-in may be considered taxable income in your jurisdiction. In the United States, tips are generally taxable as income. The annual gift tax exclusion for 2026 is $19,000 per recipient—tips exceeding this amount may trigger gift tax reporting requirements for the sender. Artists receiving tips are responsible for reporting all tip income on their tax returns.

                  <strong>Automatic Sales Tax Collection (Stripe Tax):</strong> For BopShop merchandise sales, Boptone automatically calculates and collects sales tax, VAT, and GST using Stripe Tax based on the customer's billing address and applicable tax jurisdictions. Tax amounts are determined by Stripe Tax's real-time tax calculation engine, which accounts for product taxability, customer location, and local tax rates. Collected taxes are remitted directly to tax authorities by Stripe on your behalf in supported jurisdictions. You remain responsible for tax compliance in jurisdictions not covered by Stripe Tax's automatic remittance. Boptone provides tax reporting data through your dashboard to assist with tax filing obligations.

                  Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at hello@boptone.com.

                  Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service that cannot be resolved informally shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules.

                  If you are a California resident, you may have certain additional rights. California Civil Code Section 1789.3 requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers for information about their practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, such businesses may adopt a policy of not disclosing personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing. We have opted for the alternative option and do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent.
