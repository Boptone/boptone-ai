                  A Foundational Framework for Creative Sovereignty
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 mt-6">Preamble</h3>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Boptone exists to serve artists. This platform was built on a simple truth: <strong>the music industry has failed creators for generations</strong>. Record labels take ownership. Streaming platforms pay pennies. Distribution services charge fees without transparency. Social media algorithms hide your work. Payment processors hold your money. Legal agreements are written to protect everyone except you.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>We reject this model entirely.</strong>
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Boptone is not a record label. We are not a distributor. We are not a platform that extracts value from your creativity. We are an <strong>autonomous operating system</strong> built to protect your sovereignty, amplify your voice, and ensure you capture the full value of your work.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The rights enumerated below are not "granted" by Boptone. They are not privileges we bestow upon you. They are <strong>inherent to your creative work</strong> and fundamental to our relationship. We recognize these rights as foundational principles that govern every aspect of this platform.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  If we violate these rights, you have recourse. If we change these commitments, you have the power to reject those changes. If we fail you, you can leave—with your data, your works, and your dignity intact.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>These rights are enforceable. They are permanent. They are the foundation of everything we build.</strong>
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 1.1: Absolute Ownership</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  You retain 100% ownership of all creative works you upload to Boptone. We claim no ownership, no copyright interest, no equity stake, and no future rights to your music, videos, artwork, or any other creative expression. Your intellectual property remains yours, in perpetuity, without exception.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 1.2: Limited Operational License</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  By uploading your work to Boptone, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to:

                  <li>Process your work for copyright infringement detection</li>
                  <li>Analyze your work to provide you with personalized recommendations</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  This license serves <strong>your interests</strong>, not ours. It exists solely to operate the platform on your behalf. It does not grant us the right to sell your work, license it to third parties, use it for advertising, or incorporate it into products sold to others.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 1.3: No Hidden Claims</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  We will never claim ownership through:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-7 space-y-3 mb-5 text-gray-700">

                  <li>"Sublicensable" or "transferable" rights that allow us to sell your license to third parties</li>

                </ul>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  If we ever need rights beyond the operational license described above, we will request your separate, explicit, written consent—and we will compensate you fairly.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 mt-6">Article II: You Control Discovery</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 2.1: Algorithms Serve You</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Algorithms exist to help fans discover your work, not to hide it. You have the right to understand how algorithms affect your visibility, revenue, and opportunities. Upon request, we will provide:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-7 space-y-3 mb-5 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Specific factors that increased or decreased your visibility</li>
                  <li>Comparison to similar artists in your genre</li>
                  <li>Actionable recommendations to improve algorithmic performance</li>
                  <li>Historical data showing visibility trends over time</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 2.2: No Secret Penalties</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  We do not impose "shadow bans," undisclosed penalties, or algorithmic suppression. If your visibility decreases, you will know why. If your work is removed or demoted, you will receive a clear explanation. If you disagree with an algorithmic decision, you may request human review.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 2.3: Human Review Rights</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  You may request human review of any algorithmic decision that:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-7 space-y-3 mb-5 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Reduces your visibility by more than 50% compared to your prior 30-day average</li>
                  <li>Results in content removal, demotion, or restricted distribution</li>
                  <li>Affects your eligibility for promotional features or opportunities</li>
                  <li>Impacts your revenue by more than $500 in any 30-day period</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Human review will be conducted by a real person (not an automated system) within seven (7) business days. You will receive a written explanation of the decision and, if appropriate, remediation.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 2.4: Audience Transparency</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  You have the right to see exactly who viewed your work, when, and from where. Your analytics dashboard provides individual viewer data for logged-in users, aggregate demographics for anonymous viewers, traffic sources, engagement metrics, and conversion data. We do not allow "stealth viewing" by industry professionals or competitors.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 mt-6">Article III: AI Needs Your Permission</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.1: Prohibition on AI Training</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Your creative works will <strong>never</strong> be used to train artificial intelligence models, machine learning systems, or algorithmic tools without your separate, explicit, and revocable consent. This prohibition applies to platform-developed AI tools, third-party AI companies (OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.), research institutions, and any entity seeking to use your work as training data.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.2: What "AI Training" Means</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  "AI training" means incorporating your work into datasets used to teach AI models to generate new creative works. It does <strong>not</strong> include analyzing your performance metrics, detecting copyright infringement, forecasting revenue, or optimizing marketing campaigns. These analyses serve <strong>your interests</strong> and do not result in your work being incorporated into models sold or licensed to third parties.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.3: Consent Mechanism</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  If we ever wish to use your works for AI training purposes, we will request your separate, explicit, written consent for each work, explain exactly how your work will be used, disclose whether the AI model will be sold or licensed, compensate you fairly (not a token payment—real compensation), and allow you to withdraw consent at any time with immediate effect. Consent is <strong>work-specific</strong>, not account-wide.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.4: Third-Party Prohibition</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  We will never sell, license, or provide your works to third-party AI companies for training purposes without your explicit written consent. If a third party requests access to your work for AI training, we will notify you immediately, decline the request unless you affirmatively consent, provide details about the requesting party, and negotiate fair compensation on your behalf if you choose to participate.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.5: Permanent Commitment</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  This prohibition on AI training is a <strong>permanent commitment</strong>, honored in perpetuity. It cannot be modified, weakened, or removed through unilateral changes to our Terms of Service. Any amendment to this Article III requires 180 days' advance notice, approval by the Artist Policy Council (see Article IX), and opt-out rights allowing you to reject the change and continue under the original terms.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 mt-6">Article IV: Humans Review Human Decisions</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.1: Graduated Enforcement</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Account actions follow a graduated enforcement model: (1) First Violation: Warning with seven (7) days to cure; (2) Second Violation: Temporary restriction of specific features; (3) Third Violation: Account suspension with mandatory human review; (4) Egregious Violations: Immediate suspension (fraud, illegal content, threats) with expedited human review within 72 hours.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.2: Human Review Triggers</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The following decisions <strong>require</strong> human review before implementation: account suspensions affecting more than $1,000 in held funds, account suspensions for artists with more than $5,000 in annual revenue, content removal affecting portfolio pieces, payment holds exceeding seven (7) business days, and any decision affecting your ability to earn a livelihood through the platform.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.3: Appeal Rights</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  You have the right to appeal any enforcement action through a three-tier process: (1) Automated Review (48-hour response); (2) Human Review (7-day response) by a real person with authority to overturn automated decisions; (3) Independent Arbitration (30-day resolution) by an independent arbitrator not employed by Boptone, with Boptone paying all arbitration costs for disputes under $75,000.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.4: Fund Protection During Suspension</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  If your account is suspended, funds earned before suspension remain yours. Payout holds are limited to fourteen (14) business days maximum. Human review is mandatory within 72 hours for accounts with more than $1,000 in held funds. Interest accrues on held funds beyond 14 days at the federal funds rate plus 2%. If suspension is overturned, all held funds are released immediately with accrued interest.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.5: Bankruptcy Protection</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Your funds are held in segregated trust accounts, separate from Boptone's operating capital. In the event of Boptone's bankruptcy, your funds receive <strong>super-priority status</strong> ahead of all other creditors, including secured lenders, bondholders, and equity investors. You will be paid first.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  You have the right to understand how Boptone operates, how decisions are made, and how your data is used. You will see exactly what data we collect and why, how we use it, who we share it with, how long we retain it, and how to access, correct, export, or delete it. You will see financial transparency (fee calculations, revenue splits, currency conversion, tax calculations, payout processing), algorithm transparency (why your work was shown or hidden, what factors affect visibility, how to improve performance), and quarterly transparency reports disclosing data requests, privacy rights requests, security incidents, data sharing statistics, and algorithm changes affecting more than 10% of users.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Your data is portable. You can download everything in machine-readable format within 48 hours of requesting export, including all creative works in original upload quality, all metadata, all analytics data, all transaction history, all communications, and all account settings.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Boptone provides payment processing services for three distinct revenue streams: BopShop (merchandise sales), BopAudio (streaming payments), and Kick-in (fan support tips). By using these payment services, you agree to be bound by the following terms.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>BopShop Merchandise Sales:</strong> When you sell physical or digital products through BopShop, Boptone charges a platform fee of 10% of the transaction value. You are responsible for fulfilling orders, managing inventory, providing accurate product descriptions, and handling customer service. All sales are final unless otherwise required by law or your stated refund policy. We are not liable for the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of the products you sell.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>BopAudio Streaming Payments:</strong> Artists using BopAudio receive 90% of streaming revenue, with Boptone retaining 10% as a platform fee. Streaming payments are processed through our payment provider (Stripe) and are subject to their terms of service. We are not responsible for the quality, availability, or content of music streamed through BopAudio.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Kick-in Fan Support Tips:</strong> Kick-in allows fans to send monetary tips directly to artists. Boptone charges zero platform fees for tips—only standard payment processing fees apply (typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, set by our payment processor). Tips are considered gifts from fans to artists and are not refundable except as required by law. Tips are subject to velocity limits and compliance monitoring as described in Section 6.9.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Bops Video Tips:</strong> Fans may also send monetary tips to artists directly from the Bops vertical video feed. Bops tips are processed through Stripe Checkout and are subject to the same zero-platform-fee policy as Kick-in tips. Only standard Stripe payment processing fees apply. Bops tips are non-refundable except as required by applicable law. This tip stream is separate from Kick-in and is available exclusively on the Bops platform. Pro tier subscription is required for artists to receive Bops tips.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Payment Processing Provider:</strong> All payment processing is handled by Stripe, Inc., a third-party payment processor. Your use of Stripe's services is subject to their terms of service and privacy policy. We do not store your full credit card information on our servers. By using our payment services, you authorize Stripe to process payments on your behalf.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Stripe Connect Direct Payment Routing:</strong> Boptone uses Stripe Connect to facilitate direct payments from customers to artists. When a customer makes a purchase through BopShop, streams music via BopAudio, or sends a Kick-in tip, the payment is routed directly from the customer's payment method to the artist's connected Stripe account. Boptone acts as a platform facilitator and deducts the applicable platform fee (10% for BopShop, 10% for BopAudio, 0% for Kick-in) as a destination charge before the funds are deposited into the artist's account. This means artists receive payments directly from customers, not from Boptone. By using our payment services, you agree to create and maintain a Stripe Connect account and comply with Stripe's Connected Account Agreement and Services Agreement.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

We are not liable for any delays, failures, or problems inherent in the use of the internet, electronic communications, or payment processing systems outside our control. Our only responsibility is to facilitate payment transactions—we have no liability for the underlying goods, services, or content being purchased.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>All Payments Final:</strong> All payments made through the Service are final unless otherwise required by law. If you believe an unauthorized or problematic transaction has occurred, you must notify us immediately at hello@boptone.com. Unless you submit a claim within 30 days after the charge, you will have waived, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims against us arising out of or related to the transaction.

                  <strong>Currency Exchange:</strong> If your transaction requires a currency exchange, we will use the most recent foreign exchange rates sourced from one or more external vendors at the time of the transaction. Exchange rates may differ from prevailing market rates and are subject to change without notice. Currency conversion fees may apply and will be disclosed before you complete the transaction.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Velocity Limits and Transaction Monitoring:</strong> To prevent money laundering and fraud, we impose the following limits on Kick-in tips: (1) $500 maximum per transaction, (2) $1,000 maximum per day, (3) $2,500 maximum per week, (4) $10,000 maximum per month, and (5) $19,000 maximum per year. We monitor all transactions for suspicious activity and may hold, delay, or refuse transactions that violate these limits or appear fraudulent.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Suspicious Activity Reporting:</strong> We may freeze accounts, hold funds, or terminate access to payment services if we suspect fraudulent activity, money laundering, or violations of these Terms. We take fraud prevention seriously to protect all artists on the platform.

                  <strong>Fraud Warning:</strong> Use of Boptone's payment services to perform fraudulent activities or transactions may result in the permanent loss of funds with no recourse and immediate account termination.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Your Tax Responsibilities:</strong> You are solely responsible for determining, collecting, reporting, and remitting all applicable taxes on income earned through the Service, including income taxes, sales taxes, value-added taxes (VAT), goods and services taxes (GST), and any other taxes required by your jurisdiction. Boptone does not provide tax advice—consult a qualified tax professional for guidance.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Kick-in Tax Implications:</strong> Tips received through Kick-in may be considered taxable income in your jurisdiction. In the United States, tips are generally taxable as income. The annual gift tax exclusion for 2026 is $19,000 per recipient—tips exceeding this amount may trigger gift tax reporting requirements for the sender. Artists receiving tips are responsible for reporting all tip income on their tax returns.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Artist Tax Threshold Notifications:</strong> Boptone provides automatic notifications to artists when their annual Kick-in tip total reaches $15,000, $18,000, and $19,000 to help you stay aware of potential tax reporting thresholds. These notifications are provided as a courtesy and do not constitute tax advice. You remain solely responsible for complying with all tax obligations.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Tax Documentation:</strong> We may provide tax documentation (such as IRS Form 1099-K for US users) as required by law when your annual transaction volume exceeds reporting thresholds. International users may need to provide tax identification numbers (TIN, VAT ID, etc.) to comply with local regulations. Failure to provide required tax information may result in withheld payouts or account suspension.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Automatic Sales Tax Collection (Stripe Tax):</strong> For BopShop merchandise sales, Boptone automatically calculates and collects sales tax, VAT, and GST using Stripe Tax based on the customer's billing address and applicable tax jurisdictions. Tax amounts are determined by Stripe Tax's real-time tax calculation engine, which accounts for product taxability, customer location, and local tax rates. Collected taxes are remitted directly to tax authorities by Stripe on your behalf in supported jurisdictions. You remain responsible for tax compliance in jurisdictions not covered by Stripe Tax's automatic remittance.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  In accordance with Article VII of the Artist Bill of Rights, your funds receive permanent protection in the event of Boptone's financial distress:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Segregated Trust Accounts:</strong> Your funds are held in segregated trust accounts maintained by our payment processor (Stripe), separate from Boptone's operating capital. These funds are not commingled with company assets and are not available to satisfy Boptone's debts or obligations to other creditors.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Super-Priority Status:</strong> In the event of Boptone's bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, your funds receive super-priority status ahead of all other creditors, including secured lenders, bondholders, equity investors, and general unsecured creditors. You will be paid first from available assets.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Immediate Notice and Data Export:</strong> If Boptone files for bankruptcy or enters receivership, you will receive immediate notice via email and in-app notification. You will have immediate access to data export tools to download all your creative works, metadata, analytics, and transaction history. Your creative works will be deleted from our systems (not sold as bankruptcy assets) within 90 days unless you explicitly authorize otherwise.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Stripe Connect Protection:</strong> Because payments are routed directly from customers to your connected Stripe account (as described in Section 7.7), your funds are already protected from Boptone's bankruptcy. Stripe holds your funds independently, and Boptone has no legal claim to them in bankruptcy proceedings.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  In accordance with Article VII of the Artist Bill of Rights, Boptone commits to fair allocation of chargeback risk:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Platform Absorbs First $500:</strong> For each chargeback incident, Boptone absorbs the first $500 of chargeback liability. You are liable only for amounts exceeding $500 per incident, and only in cases of proven fraud, material misrepresentation, or gross negligence on your part.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Legitimate Chargebacks:</strong> For legitimate chargebacks caused by buyer's remorse, unauthorized use of buyer's payment method, or other factors outside your control, Boptone absorbs the full loss. You keep your money. This protection applies to chargebacks where you acted in good faith and fulfilled your obligations under these Terms.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Chargeback Dispute Process:</strong> If a chargeback occurs, you receive immediate notification with the chargeback reason code and customer's stated reason. You have seventy-two (72) hours to submit evidence (proof of delivery, customer communications, product descriptions, etc.). A human reviewer evaluates your evidence and makes a determination. Funds are released pending resolution unless there is clear evidence of your wrongdoing. If you win the dispute, all funds are restored with interest at the federal funds rate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Liability Limitations:</strong> You are liable for chargebacks only in the following circumstances: (1) Proven fraud (you knowingly processed fraudulent transactions or colluded with customers to defraud payment processors); (2) Material misrepresentation (you sold counterfeit goods, misrepresented product features, or failed to deliver products as described); (3) Gross negligence (you ignored obvious red flags, failed to verify high-risk orders, or systematically violated payment processing best practices).

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  In accordance with Article VII of the Artist Bill of Rights, currency conversion is calculated with full transparency:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Mid-Market Rate Plus Disclosed Markup:</strong> Currency conversion is calculated at the mid-market rate (as published by XE.com, Bloomberg, or equivalent independent source) plus a disclosed markup not to exceed 1%. The mid-market rate is the midpoint between the buy and sell rates of global currency markets, representing the fairest available exchange rate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Rate Locked at Transaction Time:</strong> The exchange rate is locked at the time of the customer's transaction, not at the time of your payout. This protects you from currency fluctuations between transaction and settlement. You receive the same exchange rate the customer paid, minus only the disclosed 1% markup.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Original Currency Payouts:</strong> You may opt to receive payouts in the original transaction currency (e.g., receive EUR for European sales instead of converting to USD). No conversion fee applies if you hold foreign currency. This option is available in your account settings under "Payout Preferences."
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Conversion Fee Disclosure:</strong> Before completing any transaction that requires currency conversion, you will see a clear disclosure showing: (1) Original transaction amount and currency; (2) Mid-market exchange rate source and timestamp; (3) Boptone's markup percentage (max 1%); (4) Final amount you will receive in your payout currency; (5) Comparison to alternative conversion methods (e.g., PayPal, bank wire) if applicable.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>No Hidden Fees:</strong> The 1% markup is the only currency conversion fee charged by Boptone. We do not impose additional "foreign transaction fees," "cross-border fees," or "international processing fees." Any additional fees charged by your bank or payment provider are disclosed separately and are not controlled by Boptone.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Boptone and its shipping carriers (including Shippo and third-party carriers such as USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL) shall not be liable for any delay, failure to deliver, or damage to shipped products caused by events beyond our reasonable control. This force majeure provision applies specifically to BopShop physical product shipments.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Force Majeure Events:</strong> The following events qualify as force majeure for shipping purposes:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-7 space-y-3 mb-5 text-gray-700">
                  <li><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Floods, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, or other acts of God that disrupt shipping infrastructure or make delivery unsafe or impossible</li>
                  <li><strong>Severe Weather:</strong> Blizzards, ice storms, extreme heat or cold, severe storms, or other weather conditions that prevent safe transportation or delivery</li>
                  <li><strong>Carrier Operational Disruptions:</strong> Delays caused by shipping carriers due to volume surges (e.g., holiday peaks), equipment failures, facility closures, labor disputes, or operational disruptions beyond Boptone's control</li>
                  <li><strong>Government Actions:</strong> Quarantines, border closures, customs delays, import/export restrictions, embargoes, travel bans, or other governmental orders that prevent or delay shipments</li>
                  <li><strong>Civil Unrest:</strong> Strikes, labor disputes, riots, protests, civil commotion, acts of terrorism, or other events that disrupt transportation networks or make delivery unsafe</li>
                  <li><strong>Infrastructure Failures:</strong> Power outages, telecommunications failures, transportation facility closures, road closures, port closures, airport closures, or other infrastructure disruptions that prevent shipment processing or delivery</li>
                  <li><strong>Public Health Emergencies:</strong> Epidemics, pandemics, or public health emergencies declared by governmental authorities that restrict movement, close facilities, or otherwise prevent normal shipping operations</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Mitigation Obligations:</strong> When a force majeure event affects shipping, Boptone will:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-7 space-y-3 mb-5 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Notify affected customers via email within three (3) business days of becoming aware of the delay</li>
                  <li>Provide estimated delivery timelines based on available information from carriers</li>
                  <li>Use commercially reasonable efforts to find alternative shipping methods where feasible and cost-effective</li>
                  <li>Process refunds for undelivered orders if delays exceed sixty (60) days from the original estimated delivery date</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>No Liability for Force Majeure Delays:</strong> Neither Boptone nor artists/sellers shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from shipping delays or failures caused by force majeure events. This includes but is not limited to lost profits, lost revenue, costs of substitute goods, or any other commercial losses.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Customer Rights:</strong> If a force majeure event delays shipping for more than thirty (30) days beyond the original estimated delivery date, customers may cancel their order and receive a full refund of the purchase price (including shipping fees). Refund requests must be submitted to hello@boptone.com with the order number and reason for cancellation.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Seller Obligations:</strong> Artists/sellers using BopShop remain responsible for fulfilling orders in good faith, providing accurate estimated delivery timelines, communicating proactively with customers about delays, and processing refunds in accordance with their stated refund policies. Force majeure does not excuse sellers from these obligations, but it does limit liability for delays caused by events beyond their control.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Insurance and Tracking:</strong> Boptone strongly recommends that sellers purchase shipping insurance and tracking for all orders, particularly high-value items. While force majeure events limit liability for delays, insurance provides additional protection for lost or damaged shipments. Sellers may pass reasonable insurance costs to customers as part of shipping fees.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  In accordance with Article III of the Artist Bill of Rights, your creative works will <strong>never</strong> be used to train artificial intelligence models, machine learning systems, or algorithmic tools without your separate, explicit, and revocable consent.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>What "AI Training" Means:</strong> "AI training" means incorporating your work into datasets used to teach AI models to generate new creative works (music generation, video generation, image generation, text generation based on creative works). It does <strong>not</strong> include analyzing your performance metrics for recommendations, detecting copyright infringement, forecasting revenue, optimizing marketing campaigns, or other analyses that serve your interests and do not result in your work being incorporated into models sold or licensed to third parties.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Explicit Prohibition:</strong> The license grant in Section 9.3 does <strong>not</strong> include the right to use your works for AI training. The phrase "prepare derivative works" in Section 9.3 is limited to operational purposes (format conversion, thumbnail generation, audio transcoding) and does not include AI training. If there is any ambiguity, this prohibition controls.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Third-Party Prohibition:</strong> We will never sell, license, or provide your works to third-party AI companies (OpenAI, Google, Meta, Anthropic, etc.) for training purposes without your explicit written consent. If a third party requests access to your work for AI training, we will notify you immediately, decline the request unless you affirmatively consent, provide details about the requesting party, and negotiate fair compensation on your behalf if you choose to participate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Consent Mechanism:</strong> If we ever wish to use your works for AI training purposes, we will request your separate, explicit, written consent for each work, explain exactly how your work will be used, disclose whether the AI model will be sold or licensed, compensate you fairly (not a token payment—real compensation based on the commercial value of the AI model), and allow you to withdraw consent at any time with immediate effect. Consent is work-specific, not account-wide.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Permanent Commitment:</strong> This prohibition on AI training is a permanent commitment, honored in perpetuity. It cannot be modified, weakened, or removed through unilateral changes to these Terms of Service. Any amendment to this Section 9.5 requires 180 days' advance notice, approval by the Artist Policy Council (see Section 1, Article IX), and opt-out rights allowing you to reject the change and continue under the original terms.

However, we cannot guarantee the deletion timeline for third-party platforms, as they operate independently. We will provide you with confirmation of our notification to each platform.

                  All audio contained in a Bops video &mdash; including background music, sound effects, vocal samples, and instrumental loops &mdash; must be either (a) original content you created and own, (b) licensed under a valid synchronization license that covers use in a publicly distributed video, (c) released under a Creative Commons or similar open license that permits commercial use, or (d) in the public domain. The following are explicitly prohibited:

                  <li><strong>"De minimis" defense is not a defense here:</strong> Boptone does not recognize the informal "de minimis" argument for unlicensed sampling. Any recognizable portion of a copyrighted work requires a license, consistent with the standard established in <em>Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films</em> (6th Cir. 2004) for sound recordings</li>
                  <li><strong>AI-generated audio trained on unlicensed works:</strong> Audio generated by AI models that were trained on copyrighted recordings without license or consent, as further addressed in Section 9.12</li>

                  <strong>Sync License Requirement:</strong> Even if you hold a mechanical license (e.g., for a cover song distributed through BopAudio), a mechanical license does not grant synchronization rights.

                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Uptime Commitment:</strong> We commit to maintaining 99.5% uptime for core platform services (account access, content upload, payment processing, analytics dashboard) measured monthly. Scheduled maintenance windows (announced 7 days in advance) are excluded from uptime calculation. If we fail to meet this commitment, you are entitled to a pro-rated refund of subscription fees for the affected period.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Security Commitment:</strong> We commit to implementing industry-standard security measures including data encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256), regular security audits by independent third parties (annual penetration testing), prompt patching of critical vulnerabilities (within 72 hours of discovery), and immediate notification of data breaches affecting your account (within 72 hours of discovery).
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Fraud Protection Commitment:</strong> We commit to implementing fraud detection systems to protect your account from unauthorized access, monitoring for suspicious payment activity and chargebacks, providing two-factor authentication (2FA) and other security features, and absorbing chargeback risk as described in Section 7.13.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Human Review Commitment:</strong> As described in Article IV of the Artist Bill of Rights, we commit to providing human review for account actions affecting more than $1,000 in held funds, account suspensions for artists with more than $5,000 in annual revenue, content removal affecting portfolio pieces, and payment holds exceeding seven (7) business days.

                  <strong>Data Backup Commitment:</strong> We commit to maintaining redundant backups of your content and data across multiple geographic locations, performing daily incremental backups and weekly full backups, retaining backups for 90 days for disaster recovery purposes, and providing data export tools within 48 hours of your request.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Platform Obligations:</strong> These commitments represent Boptone's obligations to you and are enforceable under the Artist Bill of Rights.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Exclusions:</strong> These commitments do not apply to: (1) Third-party services beyond our control (Stripe payment processing, Instagram/TikTok integrations, etc.); (2) AI-generated recommendations or predictions (which remain "as is" and should not be relied upon as professional advice); (3) Force majeure events as defined in Section 15.2 below; (4) Downtime caused by your actions (DDoS attacks, abuse of service, violation of Terms).

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The service commitments outlined in Section 15.1 (99.5% uptime, 48-hour settlement, human review response times, security measures, data backup) may be suspended or delayed due to force majeure events beyond Boptone's reasonable control. This provision protects both Boptone and artists from liability for service disruptions caused by extraordinary circumstances.

                  <li><strong>Infrastructure Failures:</strong> Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, data center outages, cloud provider failures (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), internet backbone disruptions, DNS failures, or other infrastructure events that prevent access to core services</li>
                  <li><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Earthquakes, floods, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, or other natural disasters affecting our data centers, service providers, or personnel</li>
                  <li><strong>Cyber Attacks:</strong> Hacking attempts, malware infections, ransomware attacks, or other cybersecurity incidents that require taking systems offline for remediation or investigation</li>
                  <li><strong>Third-Party Service Failures:</strong> Failures by critical third-party service providers (Stripe for payments, Shippo for shipping, email providers, authentication services, CDN providers) that prevent us from fulfilling our obligations</li>
                  <li><strong>Government Actions:</strong> Court orders, law enforcement requests, regulatory actions, or governmental orders that require us to suspend or modify services</li>
                  <li><strong>Public Health Emergencies:</strong> Epidemics, pandemics, or public health emergencies that prevent our personnel from accessing facilities, performing essential functions, or maintaining normal operations</li>
                  <li><strong>Telecommunications Failures:</strong> Internet service provider outages, fiber optic cable cuts, routing failures, or other telecommunications disruptions beyond our control</li>
                  <li><strong>Power Outages:</strong> Electrical grid failures, rolling blackouts, or power supply disruptions affecting data centers or critical infrastructure</li>

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Mitigation Obligations:</strong> When a force majeure event affects service commitments, Boptone will:

                <ul className="list-disc pl-7 space-y-3 mb-5 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Post a status update on our website and send email notifications to affected users within two (2) hours of identifying the issue</li>
                  <li>Provide regular updates (at least every 12 hours) on remediation progress and estimated time to resolution</li>
                  <li>Use commercially reasonable efforts to restore services as quickly as possible, including activating backup systems, engaging third-party support, and implementing emergency procedures</li>
                  <li>Implement redundant systems and failover mechanisms to minimize future occurrences of similar events</li>
                  <li>Conduct post-incident reviews and publish findings to improve transparency and prevent recurrence</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>No Liability for Force Majeure:</strong> Boptone shall not be liable for any breach of service commitments (including 99.5% uptime, 48-hour settlement, human review response times, or security measures) to the extent caused by force majeure events. However, force majeure does not excuse:
                </p>

                  <li><strong>Payment Obligations:</strong> Boptone's obligation to remit artist earnings already collected (though settlement timeline may be extended during force majeure)</li>
                  <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Boptone's obligation to maintain reasonable security measures (though specific security incidents caused by force majeure may qualify as excused events)</li>
                  <li><strong>Gross Negligence:</strong> Failures caused by Boptone's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or failure to implement industry-standard redundancy and disaster recovery systems</li>
                  <li><strong>Data Backup:</strong> Boptone's obligation to maintain redundant backups (force majeure may delay restoration but does not excuse failure to maintain backups)</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Extended Force Majeure:</strong> If a force majeure event prevents Boptone from providing core services (user authentication, content hosting, payment processing) for more than thirty (30) consecutive days, users may terminate their accounts without penalty and request immediate data export. Boptone will provide data export tools within 48 hours of termination request, even during force majeure events.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Compensation and Refunds:</strong> Force majeure events do not entitle users to pro-rated refunds of subscription fees for the affected period. However, if force majeure causes service disruptions exceeding seven (7) consecutive days, Boptone will extend subscription periods by the duration of the outage at no additional cost.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Notice and Documentation:</strong> Boptone will provide written notice of force majeure events within two (2) hours of identification, including description of the event, expected duration, affected services, and mitigation steps being taken. Upon request, Boptone will provide documentation supporting the force majeure claim, including third-party incident reports, government orders, or other evidence demonstrating the event was beyond our reasonable control.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  While the above liability limitations remain in effect for legal protection, in accordance with the Artist Bill of Rights, Boptone commits to the following tiered liability structure that scales with your platform usage:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Free Tier Users ($0/month subscription):</strong> Liability cap remains at the greater of (A) amounts paid to Boptone in the prior 12 months, or (B) $100 USD.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Pro Tier Users ($49/month subscription):</strong> Liability cap increased to the greater of (A) amounts paid to Boptone in the prior 12 months, or (B) $1,000 USD.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Enterprise Tier Users ($149/month subscription):</strong> Liability cap increased to the greater of (A) amounts paid to Boptone in the prior 12 months, or (B) $5,000 USD.

                  <strong>High-Revenue Artists (&gt;$10,000 annual revenue through platform):</strong> Liability cap increased to the greater of (A) amounts paid to Boptone in the prior 12 months, (B) 10% of your annual revenue through the platform, or (C) $10,000 USD, whichever is greatest.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Rationale:</strong> Artists who generate significant revenue through Boptone deserve liability protection commensurate with their platform usage. A flat $100 cap is unconscionable for artists earning $50,000/year through the platform. These tiered caps ensure fair risk allocation while maintaining platform viability.

Just as Boptone's liability is capped, your liability to Boptone is also capped at the same amounts (subject to the same carve-outs for fraud, gross negligence, and IP violations). This ensures mutual fairness and prevents one-sided risk allocation.

                  Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service that cannot be resolved informally shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, California, unless you and Boptone agree otherwise.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

                  These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute not subject to arbitration shall be the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

                  In accordance with Article IV of the Artist Bill of Rights and to comply with AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, you have the right to opt out of the arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of account creation or acceptance of these Terms.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>How to Opt Out:</strong> To opt out, send an email to hello@boptone.com with the subject line "Arbitration Opt-Out" and include: (1) Your full name; (2) Your account email address; (3) Your account username or artist name; (4) A clear statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement.

                  <strong>Effect of Opt-Out:</strong> If you opt out, you and Boptone agree that any disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California (subject to the small claims exception below). You retain the right to bring class action lawsuits if you opt out. Opting out of arbitration does not affect any other terms of this agreement.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 mt-6">18.2 Small Claims Exception (Core Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Notwithstanding the arbitration agreement, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes under $10,000 USD. Small claims court provides a faster, less expensive forum for resolving minor disputes without the formality of arbitration or full litigation.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Scope:</strong> The small claims exception applies to disputes seeking monetary damages under $10,000 USD, injunctive relief for minor violations (e.g., account access issues, content removal disputes), or declaratory relief for interpretation of specific Terms provisions.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Procedure:</strong> Small claims actions may be filed in the small claims court in your county of residence or in Los Angeles County, California. You are not required to attempt informal resolution before filing in small claims court, though we encourage it.

                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The class action waiver in Section 18.3 does <strong>not</strong> apply to violations of the Artist Bill of Rights (Section 1) that affect more than 1,000 users. In accordance with Article X of the Artist Bill of Rights, you retain the right to bring class action lawsuits for:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-7 space-y-3 mb-5 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Unauthorized AI training on artist works (Article III violation)</li>

                  <li>Failure to provide human review as promised (Article IV violation)</li>

                  <li>Any other systematic violation of the Artist Bill of Rights affecting more than 1,000 users</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Rationale:</strong> Class actions are the only practical remedy for systematic violations affecting thousands of artists. Individual arbitration is insufficient when the platform violates core commitments at scale. This carve-out ensures accountability for widespread abuses.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 mt-6">18.4 Cost-Shifting for Frivolous Claims (Core Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  To prevent abuse of the dispute resolution process, either party may seek recovery of attorneys' fees and costs for frivolous claims:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Frivolous Claims Defined:</strong> A claim is "frivolous" if it: (1) Has no reasonable basis in law or fact; (2) Is brought primarily for harassment or delay; (3) Makes allegations the claimant knows to be false; (4) Seeks damages grossly disproportionate to any alleged harm.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Cost-Shifting:</strong> If an arbitrator or court determines that a claim is frivolous, the losing party must pay the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees, arbitration costs, and other expenses. This applies equally to frivolous claims brought by Boptone or by users.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Protection for Good Faith Claims:</strong> A claim is not frivolous merely because it is unsuccessful. You will not be penalized for bringing a good faith claim that ultimately fails on the merits. Cost-shifting applies only to claims brought in bad faith or with no reasonable basis.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 mt-6">18.5 Human Review Triggers (Core Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  In accordance with Article IV of the Artist Bill of Rights, certain disputes trigger mandatory human review before arbitration or litigation:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Mandatory Human Review:</strong> Before initiating arbitration or litigation, Boptone must provide human review (not automated decision) for disputes involving: (1) Account suspensions affecting more than $1,000 in held funds; (2) Account suspensions for artists with more than $5,000 in annual revenue; (3) Content removal affecting portfolio pieces; (4) Payment holds exceeding seven (7) business days; (5) Any decision affecting your ability to earn a livelihood through the platform.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Review Timeline:</strong> Human review must be completed within seven (7) business days of your request. You will receive a written explanation of the decision, including specific facts supporting the decision, applicable Terms provisions, and remediation options if appropriate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Effect on Dispute Resolution:</strong> If human review resolves the dispute to your satisfaction, no arbitration or litigation is necessary. If human review does not resolve the dispute, you may proceed with arbitration or litigation (subject to the opt-out and small claims exceptions above).

                  <strong>Grandfathering Period:</strong> For core amendments, artists who joined before the amendment's effective date may continue under the original terms for twelve (12) months.

                  <strong>Advance Notice:</strong> If Boptone decides to discontinue the Service entirely, we will provide at least ninety (90) days' advance notice via email and prominent notice on the Service. This gives artists time to migrate to alternative platforms.
