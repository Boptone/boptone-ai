                <p className="mb-4 text-lg font-semibold italic">
                  A Constitutional Framework for Creative Sovereignty
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Preamble</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Boptone exists to serve artists. This platform was built on a simple truth: <strong>the music industry has failed creators for generations</strong>. Record labels take ownership. Streaming platforms pay pennies. Distribution services charge fees without transparency. Social media algorithms hide your work. Payment processors hold your money. Legal agreements are written to protect everyone except you.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>We reject this model entirely.</strong>
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Boptone is not a record label. We are not a distributor. We are not a platform that extracts value from your creativity. We are an <strong>autonomous operating system</strong> built to protect your sovereignty, amplify your voice, and ensure you capture the full value of your work.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  The rights enumerated below are not "granted" by Boptone. They are not privileges we bestow upon you. They are <strong>inherent to your creative work</strong> and fundamental to our relationship. We recognize these rights as constitutional principles that govern every aspect of this platform.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  If we violate these rights, you have recourse. If we change these commitments, you have the power to reject those changes. If we fail you, you can leave—with your data, your works, and your dignity intact.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>These rights are enforceable. They are permanent. They are the foundation of everything we build.</strong>
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Article I: Your Work Is Yours</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 1.1: Absolute Ownership</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  You retain 100% ownership of all creative works you upload to Boptone. We claim no ownership, no copyright interest, no equity stake, and no future rights to your music, videos, artwork, or any other creative expression. Your intellectual property remains yours, in perpetuity, without exception.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 1.2: Limited Operational License</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  By uploading your work to Boptone, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                  <li>Display your work in your portfolio and public-facing pages</li>
                  <li>Distribute your work to platforms you explicitly authorize</li>
                  <li>Process your work for copyright infringement detection</li>
                  <li>Analyze your work to provide you with personalized recommendations</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  This license serves <strong>your interests</strong>, not ours. It exists solely to operate the platform on your behalf. It does not grant us the right to sell your work, license it to third parties, use it for advertising, or incorporate it into products sold to others.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 1.3: No Hidden Claims</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  We will never claim ownership through:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                  <li>Vague "derivative works" language that could include AI training</li>
                  <li>"Perpetual" or "irrevocable" licenses that survive account termination</li>
                  <li>"Sublicensable" or "transferable" rights that allow us to sell your license to third parties</li>
                  <li>Terms buried in fine print or added through unilateral modifications</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  If we ever need rights beyond the operational license described above, we will request your separate, explicit, written consent—and we will compensate you fairly.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Article II: You Control Discovery</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 2.1: Algorithms Serve You</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Algorithms exist to help fans discover your work, not to hide it. You have the right to understand how algorithms affect your visibility, revenue, and opportunities. Upon request, we will provide:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                  <li>Specific factors that increased or decreased your visibility</li>
                  <li>Comparison to similar artists in your genre</li>
                  <li>Actionable recommendations to improve algorithmic performance</li>
                  <li>Historical data showing visibility trends over time</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 2.2: No Secret Penalties</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  We do not impose "shadow bans," undisclosed penalties, or algorithmic suppression. If your visibility decreases, you will know why. If your work is removed or demoted, you will receive a clear explanation. If you disagree with an algorithmic decision, you may request human review.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 2.3: Human Review Rights</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  You may request human review of any algorithmic decision that:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                  <li>Reduces your visibility by more than 50% compared to your prior 30-day average</li>
                  <li>Results in content removal, demotion, or restricted distribution</li>
                  <li>Affects your eligibility for promotional features or opportunities</li>
                  <li>Impacts your revenue by more than $500 in any 30-day period</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Human review will be conducted by a real person (not an automated system) within seven (7) business days. You will receive a written explanation of the decision and, if appropriate, remediation.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 2.4: Audience Transparency</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  You have the right to see exactly who viewed your work, when, and from where. Your analytics dashboard provides individual viewer data for logged-in users, aggregate demographics for anonymous viewers, traffic sources, engagement metrics, and conversion data. We do not allow "stealth viewing" by industry professionals or competitors.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Article III: AI Needs Your Permission</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.1: Prohibition on AI Training</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Your creative works will <strong>never</strong> be used to train artificial intelligence models, machine learning systems, or algorithmic tools without your separate, explicit, and revocable consent. This prohibition applies to platform-developed AI tools, third-party AI companies (OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.), research institutions, and any entity seeking to use your work as training data.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.2: What "AI Training" Means</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  "AI training" means incorporating your work into datasets used to teach AI models to generate new creative works. It does <strong>not</strong> include analyzing your performance metrics, detecting copyright infringement, forecasting revenue, or optimizing marketing campaigns. These analyses serve <strong>your interests</strong> and do not result in your work being incorporated into models sold or licensed to third parties.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.3: Consent Mechanism</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  If we ever wish to use your works for AI training purposes, we will request your separate, explicit, written consent for each work, explain exactly how your work will be used, disclose whether the AI model will be sold or licensed, compensate you fairly (not a token payment—real compensation), and allow you to withdraw consent at any time with immediate effect. Consent is <strong>work-specific</strong>, not account-wide.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.4: Third-Party Prohibition</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  We will never sell, license, or provide your works to third-party AI companies for training purposes without your explicit written consent. If a third party requests access to your work for AI training, we will notify you immediately, decline the request unless you affirmatively consent, provide details about the requesting party, and negotiate fair compensation on your behalf if you choose to participate.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 3.5: Permanent Commitment</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  This prohibition on AI training is a <strong>permanent commitment</strong>, honored in perpetuity. It cannot be modified, weakened, or removed through unilateral changes to our Terms of Service. Any amendment to this Article III requires 180 days' advance notice, approval by the Artist Policy Council (see Article IX), and opt-out rights allowing you to reject the change and continue under the original terms.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Article IV: Humans Review Human Decisions</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.1: Graduated Enforcement</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Account actions follow a graduated enforcement model: (1) First Violation: Warning with seven (7) days to cure; (2) Second Violation: Temporary restriction of specific features; (3) Third Violation: Account suspension with mandatory human review; (4) Egregious Violations: Immediate suspension (fraud, illegal content, threats) with expedited human review within 72 hours.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.2: Human Review Triggers</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  The following decisions <strong>require</strong> human review before implementation: account suspensions affecting more than $1,000 in held funds, account suspensions for artists with more than $5,000 in annual revenue, content removal affecting portfolio pieces, payment holds exceeding seven (7) business days, and any decision affecting your ability to earn a livelihood through the platform.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.3: Appeal Rights</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  You have the right to appeal any enforcement action through a three-tier process: (1) Automated Review (48-hour response); (2) Human Review (7-day response) by a real person with authority to overturn automated decisions; (3) Independent Arbitration (30-day resolution) by an independent arbitrator not employed by Boptone, with Boptone paying all arbitration costs for disputes under $75,000.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.4: Fund Protection During Suspension</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  If your account is suspended, funds earned before suspension remain yours. Payout holds are limited to fourteen (14) business days maximum. Human review is mandatory within 72 hours for accounts with more than $1,000 in held funds. Interest accrues on held funds beyond 14 days at the federal funds rate plus 2%. If suspension is overturned, all held funds are released immediately with accrued interest.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 4.5: Bankruptcy Protection</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Your funds are held in segregated trust accounts, separate from Boptone's operating capital. In the event of Boptone's bankruptcy, your funds receive <strong>super-priority status</strong> ahead of all other creditors, including secured lenders, bondholders, and equity investors. You will be paid first.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Article V: Transparency Is Built In</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  You have the right to understand how Boptone operates, how decisions are made, and how your data is used. You will see exactly what data we collect and why, how we use it, who we share it with, how long we retain it, and how to access, correct, export, or delete it. You will see financial transparency (fee calculations, revenue splits, currency conversion, tax calculations, payout processing), algorithm transparency (why your work was shown or hidden, what factors affect visibility, how to improve performance), and quarterly transparency reports disclosing data requests, privacy rights requests, security incidents, data sharing statistics, and algorithm changes affecting more than 10% of users.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Article VI: You Can Leave Anytime (With Your Data)</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 6.1: True Data Portability</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Your data is portable. You can download everything in machine-readable format within 48 hours of requesting export, including all creative works in original upload quality, all metadata, all analytics data, all transaction history, all communications, and all account settings. Data export is provided in standard formats (JSON, CSV, MP3, MP4, PNG, etc.) that work with competing platforms.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 6.2: Content Deletion Timeline</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  When you delete content, we commit to: immediate removal from public-facing pages (within 1 hour), 24-hour removal from content delivery networks, 30-day removal from backup systems, and 90-day removal from all platform systems (except legal holds). We retain only transaction records (7 years for tax compliance), copyright infringement reports (DMCA), court-ordered legal holds, and anonymized analytics data.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 6.3: Verification</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Upon request, we will provide written confirmation that your content has been deleted, including specific deletion dates, confirmation that backups have been purged, confirmation that third-party distribution partners have been notified, and a list of any legal retention exceptions and their expiration dates.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Article VII: We Protect Your Livelihood</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 7.1: Settlement Guarantees</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Payments owed to you are settled within <strong>48 hours</strong> of transaction completion, subject to fraud screening (completed within 24 hours for 99% of transactions), payment processor settlement times (Stripe settles daily), and your chosen payout schedule (daily, weekly, or monthly). Reserves are capped at 10% of transaction value and held only for fraud protection, not as working capital.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 7.2: Fraud Chargeback Allocation</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Boptone absorbs chargeback risk for the first $500 per incident. You are liable only for proven fraud, material misrepresentation, or gross negligence. For legitimate chargebacks (buyer's remorse, unauthorized use), Boptone absorbs the loss. You keep your money.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 7.3: Currency Conversion Transparency</strong></p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Currency conversion is calculated at mid-market rate (as published by XE.com or equivalent) plus disclosed markup not to exceed 1%, locked at transaction time (not payout time). You may opt to receive payouts in the original transaction currency with no conversion fee.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Article VIII: Questions Get Answers (From a Real Person)</h3>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Support quality scales with your platform usage. All users receive automated chatbot (instant response) and email support (48-hour response). Pro tier users receive priority email (24-hour response) and live chat during business hours. Enterprise tier users receive dedicated account manager (4-hour response) and phone support. High-revenue artists (&gt;$10,000 annual revenue) receive dedicated account manager regardless of subscription tier, priority escalation for urgent issues (2-hour response), and direct access to executive team for policy concerns.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  Major policy changes require approval from the Artist Policy Council, composed of 5 Artist Representatives (elected annually by artists with &gt;$1,000 annual revenue), 3 Platform Representatives (Boptone executives), and 2 Independent Experts (legal, financial, or industry experts).

                <p className="mb-4">
                  If Boptone violates this Artist Bill of Rights in a manner that affects more than 1,000 users, you have the right to bring a class action lawsuit (not subject to arbitration clause), seek liquidated damages of $500 per violation or actual damages (whichever is greater), recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and obtain injunctive relief to stop ongoing violations.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-2"><strong>Section 10.2: Independent Audit Rights</strong></p>

                  <strong>Payout Schedules:</strong> You may choose to receive payouts on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule through your account settings. All payout schedules are subject to a minimum withdrawal amount of $20 USD (or equivalent in your local currency). Standard payouts are processed at no additional cost and typically arrive in your designated bank account or payment method within one (1) business day of the payout request, subject to banking processing times.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payment Methods:</strong> We support various payout methods including direct bank transfer (ACH in the US, SEPA in Europe), PayPal, and other region-specific payment providers. The availability of specific payment methods depends on your location and account verification status.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Verification Requirements:</strong> To receive payouts, you must complete identity verification and provide accurate banking or payment information. We may request additional documentation to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Failure to complete verification may result in delayed or withheld payouts.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payout Holds:</strong> We reserve the right to hold payouts for up to 30 days in cases of suspected fraud, chargebacks, disputes, or violations of these Terms. We will notify you of any holds and the reasons for them.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Currency Conversion:</strong> If your payout currency differs from the currency in which you earned revenue, we will convert funds at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of payout. Currency conversion fees may apply and will be clearly disclosed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tax Reporting:</strong> You are responsible for reporting all income earned through the Service and paying applicable taxes. We may provide tax documentation (such as 1099 forms for US users) as required by law. International users may need to provide tax identification information to comply with local regulations.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">7.7 Payment Processing Services</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Boptone provides payment processing services for three distinct revenue streams: BopShop (merchandise sales), BopAudio (streaming payments), and Kick-in (fan support tips). By using these payment services, you agree to be bound by the following terms.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>BopShop Merchandise Sales:</strong> When you sell physical or digital products through BopShop, Boptone charges a platform fee of 10% of the transaction value. You are responsible for fulfilling orders, managing inventory, providing accurate product descriptions, and handling customer service. All sales are final unless otherwise required by law or your stated refund policy. We are not liable for the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of the products you sell.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>BopAudio Streaming Payments:</strong> Artists using BopAudio receive 90% of streaming revenue, with Boptone retaining 10% as a platform fee. Streaming payments are processed through our payment provider (Stripe) and are subject to their terms of service. We are not responsible for the quality, availability, or content of music streamed through BopAudio.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Kick-in Fan Support Tips:</strong> Kick-in allows fans to send monetary tips directly to artists. Boptone charges zero platform fees for tips—only standard payment processing fees apply (typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, set by our payment processor). Tips are considered gifts from fans to artists and are not refundable except as required by law. Tips are subject to velocity limits and compliance monitoring as described in Section 6.9.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payment Processing Provider:</strong> All payment processing is handled by Stripe, Inc., a third-party payment processor. Your use of Stripe's services is subject to their terms of service and privacy policy. We do not store your full credit card information on our servers. By using our payment services, you authorize Stripe to process payments on your behalf.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Stripe Connect Direct Payment Routing:</strong> Boptone uses Stripe Connect to facilitate direct payments from customers to artists. When a customer makes a purchase through BopShop, streams music via BopAudio, or sends a Kick-in tip, the payment is routed directly from the customer's payment method to the artist's connected Stripe account. Boptone acts as a platform facilitator and deducts the applicable platform fee (10% for BopShop, 10% for BopAudio, 0% for Kick-in) as a destination charge before the funds are deposited into the artist's account. This means artists receive payments directly from customers, not from Boptone. By using our payment services, you agree to create and maintain a Stripe Connect account and comply with Stripe's Connected Account Agreement and Services Agreement.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Platform Liability Limitations:</strong> We provide payment processing services "as is" and to the maximum extent permitted by law, disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We are not liable for any delays, failures, or problems inherent in the use of the internet, electronic communications, or payment processing systems outside our control. Our only responsibility is to facilitate payment transactions—we have no liability for the underlying goods, services, or content being purchased.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>All Payments Final:</strong> All payments made through the Service are final unless otherwise required by law. If you believe an unauthorized or problematic transaction has occurred, you must notify us immediately at hello@boptone.com. Unless you submit a claim within 30 days after the charge, you will have waived, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims against us arising out of or related to the transaction.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">7.8 Multi-Currency Transactions</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Boptone supports transactions in 135+ currencies and accepts 18 global payment methods, including credit/debit cards, CashApp, Klarna, WeChat Pay, Alipay, and other region-specific payment methods. The availability of specific payment methods depends on your location and the transaction type.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Currency Exchange:</strong> If your transaction requires a currency exchange, we will use the most recent foreign exchange rates sourced from one or more external vendors at the time of the transaction. Exchange rates may differ from prevailing market rates and are subject to change without notice. Currency conversion fees may apply and will be disclosed before you complete the transaction.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Pricing Display:</strong> Prices displayed on the Service are in the currency you select. The final amount charged to your payment method may differ due to currency conversion, taxes, and payment processing fees. You are responsible for any additional fees charged by your bank or payment provider for international transactions.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">7.9 Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Compliance</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Boptone is committed to preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. We comply with all applicable anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Identity Verification:</strong> To use payment services, you must complete identity verification by providing government-issued identification, proof of address, and other documentation as required. We may use third-party identity verification services to confirm your identity. Failure to complete verification may result in restricted access to payment features or account suspension.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Velocity Limits and Transaction Monitoring:</strong> To prevent money laundering and fraud, we impose the following limits on Kick-in tips: (1) $500 maximum per transaction, (2) $1,000 maximum per day, (3) $2,500 maximum per week, (4) $10,000 maximum per month, and (5) $19,000 maximum per year. We monitor all transactions for suspicious activity and may hold, delay, or refuse transactions that violate these limits or appear fraudulent.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Suspicious Activity Reporting:</strong> We may freeze accounts, hold funds, or terminate access to payment services if we suspect fraudulent activity, money laundering, or violations of these Terms. We take fraud prevention seriously to protect all artists on the platform.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Fraud Warning:</strong> Use of Boptone's payment services to perform fraudulent activities or transactions may result in the permanent loss of funds with no recourse and immediate account termination. Do not attempt to structure transactions to evade reporting requirements or circumvent velocity limits—doing so will result in account termination.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">7.10 Tax Obligations and Reporting</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Your Tax Responsibilities:</strong> You are solely responsible for determining, collecting, reporting, and remitting all applicable taxes on income earned through the Service, including income taxes, sales taxes, value-added taxes (VAT), goods and services taxes (GST), and any other taxes required by your jurisdiction. Boptone does not provide tax advice—consult a qualified tax professional for guidance.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Kick-in Tax Implications:</strong> Tips received through Kick-in may be considered taxable income in your jurisdiction. In the United States, tips are generally taxable as income. The annual gift tax exclusion for 2026 is $19,000 per recipient—tips exceeding this amount may trigger gift tax reporting requirements for the sender. Artists receiving tips are responsible for reporting all tip income on their tax returns.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Artist Tax Threshold Notifications:</strong> Boptone provides automatic notifications to artists when their annual Kick-in tip total reaches $15,000, $18,000, and $19,000 to help you stay aware of potential tax reporting thresholds. These notifications are provided as a courtesy and do not constitute tax advice. You remain solely responsible for complying with all tax obligations.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Tax Documentation:</strong> We may provide tax documentation (such as IRS Form 1099-K for US users) as required by law when your annual transaction volume exceeds reporting thresholds.

                  <strong>Automatic Sales Tax Collection (Stripe Tax):</strong> For BopShop merchandise sales, Boptone automatically calculates and collects sales tax, VAT, and GST using Stripe Tax based on the customer's billing address and applicable tax jurisdictions. Tax amounts are determined by Stripe Tax's real-time tax calculation engine, which accounts for product taxability, customer location, and local tax rates. Collected taxes are remitted directly to tax authorities by Stripe on your behalf in supported jurisdictions. You remain responsible for tax compliance in jurisdictions not covered by Stripe Tax's automatic remittance. Boptone provides tax reporting data through your dashboard to assist with tax filing obligations.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">7.11 Settlement Guarantees (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In accordance with Article VII of the Artist Bill of Rights, Boptone commits to the following settlement guarantees:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>48-Hour Settlement:</strong> Payments owed to you are settled within forty-eight (48) hours of transaction completion, subject to fraud screening (completed within 24 hours for 99% of transactions), payment processor settlement times (Stripe settles daily), and your chosen payout schedule (daily, weekly, or monthly). This commitment supersedes any longer settlement periods mentioned elsewhere in these Terms.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Reserve Limitations:</strong> Payment reserves are capped at 10% of transaction value and held only for fraud protection purposes, not as working capital. Reserves exceeding this cap or held for purposes other than fraud protection violate this constitutional commitment and entitle you to immediate release of excess funds plus interest at the federal funds rate plus 2%.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payout Hold Limitations:</strong> The 30-day payout hold mentioned in Section 7.6 applies only to cases of proven fraud, chargebacks, or legal disputes. For all other situations, payout holds are limited to fourteen (14) business days maximum. Human review is mandatory within 72 hours for accounts with more than $1,000 in held funds. Interest accrues on held funds beyond 14 days at the federal funds rate plus 2%.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">7.12 Bankruptcy Protection (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In accordance with Article VII of the Artist Bill of Rights, your funds receive constitutional protection in the event of Boptone's financial distress:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Segregated Trust Accounts:</strong> Your funds are held in segregated trust accounts maintained by our payment processor (Stripe), separate from Boptone's operating capital. These funds are not commingled with company assets and are not available to satisfy Boptone's debts or obligations to other creditors.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Super-Priority Status:</strong> In the event of Boptone's bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, your funds receive super-priority status ahead of all other creditors, including secured lenders, bondholders, equity investors, and general unsecured creditors. You will be paid first from available assets.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Immediate Notice and Data Export:</strong> If Boptone files for bankruptcy or enters receivership, you will receive immediate notice via email and in-app notification. You will have immediate access to data export tools to download all your creative works, metadata, analytics, and transaction history. Your creative works will be deleted from our systems (not sold as bankruptcy assets) within 90 days unless you explicitly authorize otherwise.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Stripe Connect Protection:</strong> Because payments are routed directly from customers to your connected Stripe account (as described in Section 7.7), your funds are already protected from Boptone's bankruptcy. Stripe holds your funds independently, and Boptone has no legal claim to them in bankruptcy proceedings.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">7.13 Fraud Chargeback Allocation (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In accordance with Article VII of the Artist Bill of Rights, Boptone commits to fair allocation of chargeback risk:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Platform Absorbs First $500:</strong> For each chargeback incident, Boptone absorbs the first $500 of chargeback liability. You are liable only for amounts exceeding $500 per incident, and only in cases of proven fraud, material misrepresentation, or gross negligence on your part.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Legitimate Chargebacks:</strong> For legitimate chargebacks caused by buyer's remorse, unauthorized use of buyer's payment method, or other factors outside your control, Boptone absorbs the full loss. You keep your money. This protection applies to chargebacks where you acted in good faith and fulfilled your obligations under these Terms.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Chargeback Dispute Process:</strong> If a chargeback occurs, you receive immediate notification with the chargeback reason code and customer's stated reason. You have seventy-two (72) hours to submit evidence (proof of delivery, customer communications, product descriptions, etc.). A human reviewer evaluates your evidence and makes a determination. Funds are released pending resolution unless there is clear evidence of your wrongdoing. If you win the dispute, all funds are restored with interest at the federal funds rate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Liability Limitations:</strong> You are liable for chargebacks only in the following circumstances: (1) Proven fraud (you knowingly processed fraudulent transactions or colluded with customers to defraud payment processors); (2) Material misrepresentation (you sold counterfeit goods, misrepresented product features, or failed to deliver products as described); (3) Gross negligence (you ignored obvious red flags, failed to verify high-risk orders, or systematically violated payment processing best practices).

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">7.14 Currency Conversion Transparency (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In accordance with Article VII of the Artist Bill of Rights, currency conversion is calculated with full transparency:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Mid-Market Rate Plus Disclosed Markup:</strong> Currency conversion is calculated at the mid-market rate (as published by XE.com, Bloomberg, or equivalent independent source) plus a disclosed markup not to exceed 1%. The mid-market rate is the midpoint between the buy and sell rates of global currency markets, representing the fairest available exchange rate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Rate Locked at Transaction Time:</strong> The exchange rate is locked at the time of the customer's transaction, not at the time of your payout. This protects you from currency fluctuations between transaction and settlement. You receive the same exchange rate the customer paid, minus only the disclosed 1% markup.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Original Currency Payouts:</strong> You may opt to receive payouts in the original transaction currency (e.g., receive EUR for European sales instead of converting to USD). No conversion fee applies if you hold foreign currency. This option is available in your account settings under "Payout Preferences."
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Conversion Fee Disclosure:</strong> Before completing any transaction that requires currency conversion, you will see a clear disclosure showing: (1) Original transaction amount and currency; (2) Mid-market exchange rate source and timestamp; (3) Boptone's markup percentage (max 1%); (4) Final amount you will receive in your payout currency; (5) Comparison to alternative conversion methods (e.g., PayPal, bank wire) if applicable.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>No Hidden Fees:</strong> The 1% markup is the only currency conversion fee charged by Boptone. We do not impose additional "foreign transaction fees," "cross-border fees," or "international processing fees." Any additional fees charged by your bank or payment provider are disclosed separately and are not controlled by Boptone.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">9.5 AI Training Prohibition (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In accordance with Article III of the Artist Bill of Rights, your creative works will <strong>never</strong> be used to train artificial intelligence models, machine learning systems, or algorithmic tools without your separate, explicit, and revocable consent.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>What "AI Training" Means:</strong> "AI training" means incorporating your work into datasets used to teach AI models to generate new creative works (music generation, video generation, image generation, text generation based on creative works). It does <strong>not</strong> include analyzing your performance metrics for recommendations, detecting copyright infringement, forecasting revenue, optimizing marketing campaigns, or other analyses that serve your interests and do not result in your work being incorporated into models sold or licensed to third parties.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Explicit Prohibition:</strong> The license grant in Section 9.3 does <strong>not</strong> include the right to use your works for AI training. The phrase "prepare derivative works" in Section 9.3 is limited to operational purposes (format conversion, thumbnail generation, audio transcoding) and does not include AI training. If there is any ambiguity, this prohibition controls.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Third-Party Prohibition:</strong> We will never sell, license, or provide your works to third-party AI companies (OpenAI, Google, Meta, Anthropic, etc.) for training purposes without your explicit written consent. If a third party requests access to your work for AI training, we will notify you immediately, decline the request unless you affirmatively consent, provide details about the requesting party, and negotiate fair compensation on your behalf if you choose to participate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Consent Mechanism:</strong> If we ever wish to use your works for AI training purposes, we will request your separate, explicit, written consent for each work, explain exactly how your work will be used, disclose whether the AI model will be sold or licensed, compensate you fairly (not a token payment—real compensation based on the commercial value of the AI model), and allow you to withdraw consent at any time with immediate effect. Consent is work-specific, not account-wide.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Permanent Commitment:</strong> This prohibition on AI training is a permanent commitment, honored in perpetuity. It cannot be modified, weakened, or removed through unilateral changes to these Terms of Service. Any amendment to this Section 9.5 requires 180 days' advance notice, approval by the Artist Policy Council (see Section 1, Article IX), and opt-out rights allowing you to reject the change and continue under the original terms.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">9.6 Content Deletion Timeline (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In accordance with Article VI of the Artist Bill of Rights, when you delete content from Boptone, we commit to the following deletion timeline:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Immediate Removal:</strong> Your content is removed from all public-facing pages within one (1) hour of deletion request. This includes your artist profile, BopShop listings, BopAudio streams, and any promotional features.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>24-Hour CDN Removal:</strong> Your content is removed from content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge caches within twenty-four (24) hours. This ensures that cached copies are no longer served to users.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>30-Day Backup Removal:</strong> Your content is removed from backup systems within thirty (30) days. Backups are maintained for disaster recovery purposes only and are not accessible to Boptone employees or third parties during this period.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>90-Day Complete Removal:</strong> Your content is removed from all Boptone systems within ninety (90) days, except for: (1) Transaction records (retained for 7 years for tax compliance and financial auditing); (2) Copyright infringement reports (retained permanently for DMCA compliance); (3) Court-ordered legal holds (retained until court order expires); (4) Anonymized analytics data (stripped of all personally identifiable information and creative works).
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Third-Party Distribution:</strong> For content distributed to third-party platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) through Boptone, we will immediately notify those platforms of your deletion request and instruct them to remove your content. However, we cannot guarantee the deletion timeline for third-party platforms, as they operate independently. We will provide you with confirmation of our notification to each platform.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Verification:</strong> Upon request, we will provide written confirmation that your content has been deleted, including specific deletion dates for each system (public pages, CDN, backups, databases), confirmation that backups have been purged, confirmation that third-party distribution partners have been notified, and a list of any legal retention exceptions and their expiration dates.
                </p>

                  <li>Remove your works from Boptone at any time without penalty or fee</li>
                  <li>Transfer your works to another platform if you choose to leave Boptone</li>

                <p className="mb-4">

                  While the above disclaimers remain in effect for legal protection, in accordance with Article V of the Artist Bill of Rights, Boptone commits to the following service level standards:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Uptime Commitment:</strong> We commit to maintaining 99.5% uptime for core platform services (account access, content upload, payment processing, analytics dashboard) measured monthly. Scheduled maintenance windows (announced 7 days in advance) are excluded from uptime calculation. If we fail to meet this commitment, you are entitled to a pro-rated refund of subscription fees for the affected period.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Security Commitment:</strong> We commit to implementing industry-standard security measures including data encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256), regular security audits by independent third parties (annual penetration testing), prompt patching of critical vulnerabilities (within 72 hours of discovery), and immediate notification of data breaches affecting your account (within 72 hours of discovery).
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Fraud Protection Commitment:</strong> We commit to implementing fraud detection systems to protect your account from unauthorized access, monitoring for suspicious payment activity and chargebacks, providing two-factor authentication (2FA) and other security features, and absorbing chargeback risk as described in Section 7.13.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Human Review Commitment:</strong> As described in Article IV of the Artist Bill of Rights, we commit to providing human review for account actions affecting more than $1,000 in held funds, account suspensions for artists with more than $5,000 in annual revenue, content removal affecting portfolio pieces, and payment holds exceeding seven (7) business days.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Data Backup Commitment:</strong> We commit to maintaining redundant backups of your content and data across multiple geographic locations, performing daily incremental backups and weekly full backups, retaining backups for 90 days for disaster recovery purposes, and providing data export tools within 48 hours of your request.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Platform Obligations:</strong> These commitments represent Boptone's obligations to you and are enforceable under the Artist Bill of Rights. Failure to meet these commitments entitles you to remedies including pro-rated refunds, expedited human review, compensation for losses caused by our negligence (subject to Section 16 liability limitations), and termination without penalty with full data export.

                <p className="mb-4">

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">16.1 Tiered Liability Caps (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  While the above liability limitations remain in effect for legal protection, in accordance with the Artist Bill of Rights, Boptone commits to the following tiered liability structure that scales with your platform usage:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Free Tier Users ($0/month subscription):</strong> Liability cap remains at the greater of (A) amounts paid to Boptone in the prior 12 months, or (B) $100 USD.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Pro Tier Users ($49/month subscription):</strong> Liability cap increased to the greater of (A) amounts paid to Boptone in the prior 12 months, or (B) $1,000 USD.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Enterprise Tier Users ($149/month subscription):</strong> Liability cap increased to the greater of (A) amounts paid to Boptone in the prior 12 months, or (B) $5,000 USD.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>High-Revenue Artists (&gt;$10,000 annual revenue through platform):</strong> Liability cap increased to the greater of (A) amounts paid to Boptone in the prior 12 months, (B) 10% of your annual revenue through the platform, or (C) $10,000 USD, whichever is greatest.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Rationale:</strong> Artists who generate significant revenue through Boptone deserve liability protection commensurate with their platform usage. A flat $100 cap is unconscionable for artists earning $50,000/year through the platform. These tiered caps ensure fair risk allocation while maintaining platform viability.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">16.2 Carve-Outs from Liability Limitations (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  The liability limitations in Section 16 do <strong>not</strong> apply to the following categories of claims:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Gross Negligence and Fraud:</strong> Boptone remains fully liable for damages caused by our gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or intentional misrepresentation. We cannot disclaim liability for our own bad faith actions.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Intellectual Property Violations:</strong> Boptone remains fully liable for damages caused by our violation of your intellectual property rights, including unauthorized use of your works for AI training (in violation of Section 9.5), unauthorized licensing of your works to third parties, failure to remove infringing content after DMCA notice, or misappropriation of your creative works.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payment Processing Failures:</strong> Boptone remains fully liable for damages caused by our failure to process payments owed to you, including withheld funds beyond the timelines specified in Section 7.11, lost funds due to our negligence or system failures, unauthorized deductions from your account, or failure to maintain segregated trust accounts as promised in Section 7.12.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Data Breaches Caused by Our Negligence:</strong> Boptone remains fully liable for damages caused by data breaches resulting from our failure to implement industry-standard security measures, failure to patch known vulnerabilities within reasonable timeframes, or failure to encrypt sensitive data as promised in Section 15.1.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Violations of Artist Bill of Rights:</strong> Boptone remains fully liable for damages caused by violations of the Artist Bill of Rights (Section 1), including AI training without consent, failure to provide human review as promised, algorithm suppression without explanation, or retaliation against whistleblowers.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Death or Personal Injury:</strong> Boptone remains fully liable for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or defective products/services. This carve-out is required by law in most jurisdictions.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">16.3 Mutual Limitation (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  The liability limitations in Section 16 apply equally to both parties. Just as Boptone's liability is capped, your liability to Boptone is also capped at the same amounts (subject to the same carve-outs for fraud, gross negligence, and IP violations). This ensures mutual fairness and prevents one-sided risk allocation.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at hello@boptone.com. We will attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days of submission, you or Boptone may bring a formal proceeding.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">17.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service that cannot be resolved informally shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, California, unless you and Boptone agree otherwise.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
                </p>

                  YOU AND BOPTONE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  Notwithstanding the above, either party may bring a lawsuit in court solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Service or intellectual property infringement without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute not subject to arbitration shall be the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">18.1 Opt-Out Right (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In accordance with Article IV of the Artist Bill of Rights and to comply with AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, you have the right to opt out of the arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of account creation or acceptance of these Terms.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>How to Opt Out:</strong> To opt out, send an email to hello@boptone.com with the subject line "Arbitration Opt-Out" and include: (1) Your full name; (2) Your account email address; (3) Your account username or artist name; (4) A clear statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Effect of Opt-Out:</strong> If you opt out, you and Boptone agree that any disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California (subject to the small claims exception below). You retain the right to bring class action lawsuits if you opt out. Opting out of arbitration does not affect any other terms of this agreement.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>No Retaliation:</strong> Opting out of arbitration will not affect your access to the Service, your subscription tier, your eligibility for features, or any other aspect of your account. We will not retaliate against users who opt out.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">18.2 Small Claims Exception (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Notwithstanding the arbitration agreement, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes under $10,000 USD. Small claims court provides a faster, less expensive forum for resolving minor disputes without the formality of arbitration or full litigation.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Scope:</strong> The small claims exception applies to disputes seeking monetary damages under $10,000 USD, injunctive relief for minor violations (e.g., account access issues, content removal disputes), or declaratory relief for interpretation of specific Terms provisions.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Procedure:</strong> Small claims actions may be filed in the small claims court in your county of residence or in Los Angeles County, California. You are not required to attempt informal resolution before filing in small claims court, though we encourage it.
                </p>

                  <li>Retaliation against whistleblowers (Article X violation)</li>
                  <li>Any other systematic violation of the Artist Bill of Rights affecting more than 1,000 users</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Rationale:</strong> Class actions are the only practical remedy for systematic violations affecting thousands of artists. Individual arbitration is insufficient when the platform violates constitutional commitments at scale. This carve-out ensures accountability for widespread abuses.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">18.4 Cost-Shifting for Frivolous Claims (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  To prevent abuse of the dispute resolution process, either party may seek recovery of attorneys' fees and costs for frivolous claims:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Frivolous Claims Defined:</strong> A claim is "frivolous" if it: (1) Has no reasonable basis in law or fact; (2) Is brought primarily for harassment or delay; (3) Makes allegations the claimant knows to be false; (4) Seeks damages grossly disproportionate to any alleged harm.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Cost-Shifting:</strong> If an arbitrator or court determines that a claim is frivolous, the losing party must pay the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees, arbitration costs, and other expenses. This applies equally to frivolous claims brought by Boptone or by users.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Protection for Good Faith Claims:</strong> A claim is not frivolous merely because it is unsuccessful. You will not be penalized for bringing a good faith claim that ultimately fails on the merits. Cost-shifting applies only to claims brought in bad faith or with no reasonable basis.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">18.5 Human Review Triggers (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In accordance with Article IV of the Artist Bill of Rights, certain disputes trigger mandatory human review before arbitration or litigation:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Mandatory Human Review:</strong> Before initiating arbitration or litigation, Boptone must provide human review (not automated decision) for disputes involving: (1) Account suspensions affecting more than $1,000 in held funds; (2) Account suspensions for artists with more than $5,000 in annual revenue; (3) Content removal affecting portfolio pieces; (4) Payment holds exceeding seven (7) business days; (5) Any decision affecting your ability to earn a livelihood through the platform.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Review Timeline:</strong> Human review must be completed within seven (7) business days of your request. You will receive a written explanation of the decision, including specific facts supporting the decision, applicable Terms provisions, and remediation options if appropriate.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Effect on Dispute Resolution:</strong> If human review resolves the dispute to your satisfaction, no arbitration or litigation is necessary. If human review does not resolve the dispute, you may proceed with arbitration or litigation (subject to the opt-out and small claims exceptions above).

                <p className="mb-4">
                  We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) at any time, with or without notice, for any reason. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  We may revise these Terms from time to time. The most current version will always be posted on our website with the "Effective Date" at the top. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or through a notice on the Service prior to the changes becoming effective. By continuing to use the Service after the effective date of any changes, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">19.1 Constitutional Amendment Process (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  While Boptone retains the right to modify these Terms, amendments to the Artist Bill of Rights (Section 1) and related constitutional commitments require a heightened amendment process to protect artist sovereignty:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Ordinary Amendments (Non-Constitutional):</strong> Changes to non-constitutional provisions (eligibility, prohibited activities, account security, etc.) require thirty (30) days' advance notice via email and prominent notice on the Service. Continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Constitutional Amendments (Bill of Rights):</strong> Changes to the Artist Bill of Rights (Section 1) or related constitutional commitments (Sections 7.11-7.14, 9.5-9.8, 15.1, 16.1-16.3, 18.1-18.5, 19.1-19.3) require:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                  <li><strong>180 Days' Advance Notice:</strong> Proposed constitutional amendments must be announced 180 days before the effective date, giving artists time to review, comment, and decide whether to opt out.</li>
                  <li><strong>Policy Council Approval:</strong> Proposed constitutional amendments must be submitted to the Artist Policy Council (see Article IX of the Artist Bill of Rights) for review and approval. The Policy Council has sixty (60) days to review and vote on the proposed amendment.</li>
                  <li><strong>Public Comment Period:</strong> A thirty (30) day public comment period allows all users to submit feedback on the proposed amendment. Boptone must publish a summary of comments received and explain how they were addressed (or why they were not addressed).</li>
                  <li><strong>Supermajority Approval:</strong> Constitutional amendments require approval by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Artist Policy Council. Simple majority is insufficient for changes to foundational rights.</li>
                  <li><strong>Opt-Out Rights:</strong> Artists may opt out of constitutional amendments and continue under the original terms for twelve (12) months. After twelve months, artists who have not opted in to the new terms may export their data and close their accounts without penalty.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Prohibited Amendments:</strong> Certain constitutional commitments cannot be amended or weakened under any circumstances:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
                  <li>AI training prohibition (Section 9.5) - This is a permanent commitment</li>
                  <li>Ownership rights (Article I) - Artists always retain ownership of their works</li>
                  <li>Non-exclusivity guarantee (Section 9.7) - Boptone will never require exclusivity</li>
                  <li>Bankruptcy protection (Section 7.12) - Segregated trust accounts are permanent</li>
                  <li>Human review rights (Article IV) - Cannot be eliminated or weakened</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">19.2 Grandfathering and Opt-Out (Constitutional Commitment)</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In accordance with Article IX of the Artist Bill of Rights, artists have the right to reject amendments and continue under the original terms:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Grandfathering Period:</strong> For constitutional amendments, artists who joined before the amendment's effective date may continue under the original terms for twelve (12) months. This grandfathering period allows artists to evaluate the amendment's impact before deciding whether to accept it.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Opt-Out Mechanism:</strong> To opt out of a constitutional amendment, send an email to hello@boptone.com with the subject line "Constitutional Amendment Opt-Out" and include: (1) Your account email address; (2) The specific amendment you are opting out of; (3) A statement that you wish to continue under the original terms.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Effect of Opt-Out:</strong> If you opt out, you will continue under the original terms for twelve (12) months. After twelve months, you must either accept the new terms or export your data and close your account. Boptone will not force you to accept amendments you find unacceptable.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>No Retaliation:</strong> Opting out of amendments will not affect your access to the Service, your subscription tier, your eligibility for features, or any other aspect of your account during the grandfathering period. We will not retaliate against users who opt out.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                  While Boptone retains the right to discontinue the Service, we commit to the following protections to minimize harm to artists who depend on the platform for their livelihood:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Advance Notice:</strong> If Boptone decides to discontinue the Service entirely, we will provide at least ninety (90) days' advance notice via email and prominent notice on the Service. This gives artists time to migrate to alternative platforms.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Data Export:</strong> During the notice period, we will provide comprehensive data export tools allowing you to download: (1) All uploaded content (music, videos, artwork) in original quality; (2) All transaction history and financial records; (3) All analytics data and performance metrics; (4) All customer/fan data (email lists, purchase history, etc.); (5) All profile information and portfolio content.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Payment Settlement:</strong> All outstanding payments will be settled within seven (7) business days of service discontinuation. We will not withhold funds or impose extended hold periods merely because the Service is shutting down.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Refunds:</strong> Artists with active subscriptions will receive pro-rated refunds for the unused portion of their subscription period. If you paid for an annual subscription and the Service discontinues after six months, you will receive a 50% refund.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Migration Assistance:</strong> We will provide reasonable assistance to help artists migrate to alternative platforms, including export tools compatible with competing services, documentation on how to transfer data, and recommendations for alternative platforms (without endorsement).
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  <strong>Bankruptcy Protections:</strong> If Boptone discontinues the Service due to bankruptcy or insolvency, the bankruptcy protections in Section 7.12 remain in effect. Your funds are held in segregated trust accounts and have super-priority status in bankruptcy proceedings. You will receive your funds before Boptone's creditors are paid.
